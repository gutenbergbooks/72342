<p>When Mark Jervis came all eagerness to
claim his supper dance from Miss Gordon,
he saw at once that something was wrong.
The merry smile—her greatest charm—he
sought in vain upon her face; her expression
was grave, almost stern. She was actually
looking at him as if he was an absolute
stranger. <i>She knew!</i></p>

<p>He glanced quickly at her partner, and
the mystery was instantly solved. Yes, he
recollected the man’s goggling blue eyes.
Where had he seen him? Where? The
cordial accost—</p>

<p>“Hallo, Jervis! Came out with you in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the <i>Victoria</i>!” promptly dispelled his
last hope.</p>

<p>“Yes, so you did,” nodding. “Glad to
see you here to-night. I suppose you have
been globe-trotting, like the rest of us!”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> have not done much trotting, by
all accounts, of late.”</p>

<p>“No, not much,” rather shortly. Then,
to Honor, “This is our waltz.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him for an instant in
haughty silence, then she answered—</p>

<p>“Yes; but I don’t think I shall dance,
thank you.”</p>

<p>“Oh do,” he urged, as the stranger moved
off. “Let us have just one dance. After
the dance—the deluge! I see you know.
We can have that out later on—but <i>don’t</i>
let us miss this.”</p>

<p>The young lady was passionately fond of
dancing, the floor, the inspiriting waltz,
a first-rate partner, proved too tempting—“Yes,”
she said to herself, “just one last
waltz, and then—the deluge.” Not one
word did she utter when they halted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
a few seconds. She kept her face purposely
averted, and appeared to find an absorbing
interest in other people. When they once
more launched into the vortex, it appeared
to him that she did not dance with her
usual buoyancy and light-heartedness. She
was as stiff and as rigid as a china doll—apparently
she shrank from the support of
a millionaire’s arm—his embrace was
contamination. At last the waltz was over,
every one was streaming out, and they
naturally followed the crowd. They passed
Mrs. Brande, concealing (she fondly
believed) enormous yawns behind a black
transparent fan; they passed Mrs. Langrishe,
issuing bulletins of Sir Gloster’s
condition to several interested matrons.
They went through the verandah side by
side, down the steps, and were brought up
at last by the rustic railing overlooking the
gardens and tennis-court. It was a warm
moonlight night, bright as day, and
breathlessly still. Dozens of other couples
were strolling, standing, or sitting about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in the open air, even the chaperons had
come forth (a new and in some instances
fatal departure) to taste the sweets of a
June night in the Himalayas.</p>

<p>Before their eyes rose the long range of
snows—India’s white crown; beneath them
lay the gardens—a jungle of dew-steeped
roses, tall lilies, and great shrubs of
heliotrope. Balsac declares that perfume
reminds more vividly than words; be that
as it may, the slightest perfume of heliotrope
invariably recalled that scene and
hour to Honor Gordon’s memory.</p>

<p>“So I see that it has all come out!”
began Jervis, intrepidly, on the principle
that the first blow is half the battle, “and
that you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes”—turning slowly to face him—“and
no thanks to you, Mr. Jervis.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are awfully angry with
me. Nearly” (oh, most unfortunate
speech!) “as angry as you were with that
imp the day you tore up her picture.”</p>

<p>“I am not exactly angry,” she replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
with tremulous dignity. “Why should I be
angry? I am merely enlightened. I know
who is who now. I dare say you found the
little game of deceiving every one most
entertaining. You seem to have quite a
genius for playing a double part.”</p>

<p>“You are awfully rough on me,” he
interrupted. “But I suppose I deserve
it.”</p>

<p>“Now I have but one character, such as
it is, so I cannot reciprocate <i>your</i> surprise.
I am merely what you have always seen—a
country-bred girl, without fortune, or
prospect of one, with a taste for playing
the violin, and for speaking out my mind
at any cost.”</p>

<p>(Yes, there never was any one less at
pains to be on the safe side than this young
woman.)</p>

<p>“You are disgusted to find that I am
not a poor relation,” he ventured to remark.</p>

<p>“I am. You remember that on this very
spot”—touching the railings with her fan—“two
months ago, Colonel Sladen, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
his usual delicate taste, joked pleasantly
about the millionaire, your cousin. You
laughed immoderately then. Yes, I remember,
you actually shook the railings!
And”—with increasing wrath—“you are
smiling <i>now</i>. Of course it must be capital
fun to take people in so successfully! to be
able to laugh openly—as well as in your
sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Will you permit me to remind you of
one small fact? Do you remember that you
turned to me and said, that if I were <i>rich</i>
you would never speak to me again? You
were offering a premium on poverty.”</p>

<p>“And I repeat that speech here,” she
said, once more turning to face him.
“Now that I find you <i>are</i> rich”—she
caught her breath—“I will never speak to
you again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, I say, Miss Gordon, you can’t
mean that,” he expostulated. “At least
you will give me a hearing. Be angry—but
be just.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but began to strip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
little bits of bark from the rustic railing, to
the utter destruction of her gloves.</p>

<p>“Admitted that I am the millionaire,
that is merely to accept the nickname;
for it is not I, but my uncle, who is
wealthy. He made a fortune in trade, you
know—Pollitt’s pearl barley—and I am his
adopted son. He has brought me up ever
since I was ten years old, and has been
awfully good to me.”</p>

<p>Here she made an impatient movement,
as much as to say, What was Mr. Pollitt’s
goodness to her?</p>

<p>He hurried on faster.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see something of the world.
I was deadly sick of the routine of English
life—hunting, balls, regattas, theatres; and
I got my uncle’s consent, with great difficulty,
to spend a year in India. I was
despatched with a valet, a cargo of kit, and
the reputation of millions, with Waring as
my guide, companion, and adviser. He is
not related to me.”</p>

<p>Honor looked at him with a half ironic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
smile, as much as to say, “Of course not!
I should be surprised if he <i>were</i>.”</p>

<p>“He is Mrs. Pollitt’s brother; and she
got him the berth, such as it was,” pursued
the young man doggedly.</p>

<p>“Little dreaming how luxurious it would
become,” added the young lady sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, that was quite unpremeditated.
When I first landed, I found that I had
achieved a celebrity far beyond my wishes.
I was supposed to be a Rothschild. I was
bothered to death with touts and hawkers
and all that sort of thing”—with a constrained
laugh. “I saw that I’d have no
peace till I got rid of all my extra luggage
and the man. The combination branded
me as ‘valuable.’ Waring had been in the
country before, he knew the language and
customs, so I made over my account at the
bank into his name. He became paymaster,
and we held our tongues—that was
all. Waring looks rich, and has a genius
for spending and making a splash. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
I have not. My tastes are inexpensive,
and I have always told my uncle that
nature intended me for a poor man.”</p>

<p>Miss Gordon picked off another piece of
bark with elaborate care, and then threw
it away with an air of profound disgust.</p>

<p>“Our arrangement worked splendidly,
as long as we were merely shooting and
moving about; but when we came up here
and began to know people, I saw that
things were getting rather mixed—that it
would not <i>do</i>, that we were carrying the
idea too far. I spoke to Waring, and
suggested taking the public into our confidence.
He treated the matter as a joke,
and asked if he should announce it in the
<i>Pioneer</i>? I said, I thought that if he
told it to one or two people as a dead
secret, that it would be amply sufficient.
But he would not hear of this, either in
jest or earnest. He had, he acknowledged,
played first fiddle too long to wish to
change parts. He was most urgent that I
should leave what he considered ‘well’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
alone, and worked himself up into such
a frightful state of mind—he put the whole
thing so—so—so strongly—that I was
obliged to leave matters <i>in statu quo</i>.”</p>

<p>“Obliged!” echoed his fair listener, in
a cool, incredulous tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, forced to do so.” (He could not
tell her of the reason which had been
Waring’s sole alternative.) “He said we
had only a short time to put in, that it
would make him look such an awful fool,
that he had taken the reins to please me,
and now I must sit tight to oblige <i>him</i>.
In fact—to tell you a secret—that he would
be in dreadful financial difficulties. All he
wanted was <i>time</i>. If his creditors believed
him to be a poor man, they would be down
on him like a flock of kites. Two or
three months would set him straight. So
I yielded. But I made one stipulation; I
said I must tell the truth to one person.”</p>

<p>“And that highly honoured person?”
she asked, with arched brows.</p>

<p>“Was yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur, <i>c’en est trop</i>!” And she
made him a deep inclination.</p>

<p>“Don’t jeer at me, please,” he exclaimed,
in a low, sharp voice. “Once I was about
to speak, and I was interrupted by the
panther. Afterwards that intolerable child
took the words out of my mouth, and you
scorned them. For once in her life she
told you the truth, the whole truth—I do
love you.”</p>

<p>There was no tremble or hesitation about
these four syllables, but there was considerable
amount of trembling about the
hand which held a certain white feather
fan, resting on the railings. The fan,
unaccustomed to such uncertain treatment,
slid swiftly away, and fell like a dead white
bird into a lily bed below. No one sought
it; seconds and sensations were priceless.</p>

<p>“I do love you, better than my own life;
but I was afraid to speak, you were so down
on money.”</p>

<p>How could he guess at the nods, and
becks, and wreathed smiles of certain busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
old ladies near Hoyle, who had more than
hinted at a speedy wedding and a rich
husband, as the result of a trip to India?
How could he know of blazing eyes and
scarlet cheeks, and of a passionate repudiation
of, if not India, at any rate a handsome
future partner, and money?</p>

<p>“I meant to have told you to-night, on
my honour I did; but with my usual cruel
bad luck, that little beggar cut in before me.
And you are dead against me, and with some
reason, I confess; but you must not say
that you will never speak to me again.
Come, Miss Gordon, give me another
chance.” As she remained obdurately dumb,
he continued with an air of quiet determination,
“You will give me an answer
by the time I have fetched your fan?”</p>

<p>Honor’s anger had as usual cooled. She
now began to see things from his point of
view, and her indignation immediately
transferred itself to Captain Waring. Mr.
Jervis had been the tool and catspaw of
that unscrupulous free-and-easy gentleman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Yes, she now understood the former’s
halting allusions to hunting and polo, his
half-uttered sentences, and how he had
suddenly paused, stammered, and would
evidently have been glad to recall his own
words. Once or twice she had caught a
glimpse, instantly suppressed, of a slightly
peremptory manner, the tone and air of
one accustomed to being obeyed. She
remembered, too, his easy familiarity with
money, his—as she had hitherto considered
it—insane generosity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mark ran down and picked
up the white fan from its lily bed, shook
the dew-drops from its delicate feathers,
and, as he restored it to its owner, he
looked straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Honor,” he said, in a low eager voice,
“you will let bygones be bygones, and
forgive me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Honor hesitated, her lips trembled as if
uncertain whether to laugh or to cry.</p>

<p>“You like me a little—I hope,” he
pleaded anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The lips broke into a faint but unmistakable
smile.</p>

<p>“You are the only girl I have ever cared
two straws about. I swear that this is the
<i>truth</i>, and not the usual stock statement.
I had a presentiment that you were my
fate that night we walked along the railway
line. That Eurasian fellow in the hut had
a prophetic eye!”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that!” she said,
with sudden vehemence. “You knew very
well that you ought to have spoken out <i>long</i>
ago.”</p>

<p>“I would have spoken to you weeks ago,
but that I was uncertain what answer you
would give me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” recoiling with a gesture of
indescribable horror. “What do you think
I meant? I mean, that you might have
let us all know who you were.”</p>

<p>“Better late than never, I hope,” he
rejoined quickly. “My uncle knows all
about you. May I speak to your aunt
to-night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“What do you wish to tell her?” she
faltered.</p>

<p>“That I am going to be her nephew,”
he answered, with the utmost composure.</p>

<p>“No—no—no,” bursting into a half-hysterical
laugh, “you must give me
time—I want to think it over.”</p>

<p>“Honor,” coming close to her, and
resolutely taking her trembling hand in
his, “can you not think it over <i>now</i>? Will
you marry me?”</p>

<p>Although her fingers shook in his hold,
she held herself nervously erect, as she
stood looking out over the moon-flooded
mountains in silence, her eyes fixed on
the far-away horizon with the gaze of one
lost in meditation. She was crowding many
thoughts into the space of seconds. Among
them this—</p>

<p>“The gloved hand in which hers was
imprisoned, how strong and steadfast—a
brave hand to guide and support and
defend her through life.”</p>

<p>At last, with tremulous nervous abruptness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
she made this totally irrelevant and
unexpected remark—</p>

<p>“I wonder what people will say when
they hear what a dreadful impostor you
have been! Of course, I know what they
will say of <i>me</i>—that I have guessed the
truth all along—and have played my cards
beautifully! Oh, I can hear them saying
it!”</p>

<p>And she hastily withdrew her fingers,
and looked at him with a mixture of
defiance and dismay.</p>

<p>“You think more of what people will
say than of me, Honor!” he exclaimed
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“No, no!” filled with instant compunction,
and her blushes as she spoke were
visible even by moonlight. “I think more
of you than of any one, Mark.” Then, as if
frightened at her own confession, she
hastened to add, “Every one is going
in, and here is my next partner coming to
look for me.”</p>

<p>“Let him look!” was the unprincipled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
answer. “Shall we go down and sit on the
seat in the tennis-ground, by the big
verbena tree?”</p>

<p>“But I am engaged to Major Lawrence,”
she objected, though she knew that resistance
was useless.</p>

<p>“No doubt; but you are engaged to
<i>me</i>—you and I are to be partners for life.
Ah, ha!” with a triumphant laugh. “There,
he has been waylaid by Mrs. Troutbeck—he
won’t get away from her under an hour.
They are all going back,” glancing at many
other couples who were gravitating towards
the club; “we shall have the place to
ourselves. Come along,” and leading her
down the steps, they passed among glimmering
flower-beds, and faint sweet flowers,
to a recently vacated rustic bench. “I
dare say you have often wondered what
kept me at Shirani?” he began. “I came,
in the first instance, hoping to meet my
father. He has been thirty years out here,
he was in the Indian Cavalry, and settled
in this country, which he loves. My uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
is my adopted father, and I have seen very
little of my real father since I was a kid;
he lives in mysterious retirement in these
hills, about fifty miles away, and is a
widower for the second time. I have been
waiting on week after week, hoping that
he would send for me—that was my chief
motive for remaining at Shirani. It is no
longer so—as you very well know—in fact,
of late, you have driven him clean out of
my head!”</p>

<p>“If he were <i>my</i> father, I would go and
visit him, without waiting for an invitation,”
said Honor, resolutely.</p>

<p>“I have written several times to say
that I should like to see him, and asking
when I might start—a plain enough hint,
surely?”</p>

<p>“You are too punctilious. Why wait to
be asked? There, that waltz is over; what
a short one it was. Now I must really go
in.”</p>

<p>“What a thing it is to have a conscience!
A strong sense of duty to one’s partners!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
he exclaimed with a laugh. “However, I
am one of them myself, and I will let you
off easily.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she answered, with
uncompromising rectitude. “Pray what
about your own partners? And you are
one of the hosts, too!”</p>

<p>“I see that I may always look to you now
to remind me of my duty,” he said, rising
with extreme reluctance. “And I never
felt more inclined to shirk it than now.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I shall have quite enough to
do to remember my own shortcomings;
but at any rate I can manage to remind you
of yours to-night. <i>We</i>,” with a happy
little sigh, “shall have to-morrow,” and
she also stood up to depart.</p>

<p>“Yes, please God, thousands of to-morrows.
But, Honor, this one moment
that you are so anxious to pass by and leave
behind can never be repeated or effaced;
this hour, when you gave yourself to me
here, in this over-grown Indian garden,
under the Southern Cross. When we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
old Darby and Joan, sitting by our fireside
in cold work-a-day England, we shall—at
any rate, <i>I</i> shall—look back on this hour as
sacred,” and he put his arm round her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>The intelligence that Jervis was the
Simon Pure, the real, true, and only millionaire,
was buzzed from ear to ear, and had
soon spread over the club like wild-fire.
Mrs. Brande ceased to yawn, fanned herself
feverishly, and snappishly refused to believe
“one single word of it.” Mrs. Langrishe,
for once, sat dumb and glum. More unlikely
things had happened within her somewhat
extensive experience. Colonel Sladen
spluttered out his whole vocabulary of
ejaculations and expletives, and Lalla
Paske’s eyebrows were almost lost to sight
under her fringe! Of course it was the one
and only topic; the air was still throbbing
with the news, when, during a pause between
two dances, Mr. Jervis and Miss Gordon
walked into the ball-room. Their entrance
produced quite a dramatic effect. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
well-bred his air, how fine his profile and
the pose of his head; with what easy grace
his clothes sat upon him—clothes that were
undeniably fashioned by a first-rate London
tailor. These little details now struck
people who had hitherto scarcely spared
him a glance. As for Miss Gordon, she was
always beautiful and charming. The pair
made an uncommonly effective couple, and
they looked so radiant, that their future
happiness was evidently a settled thing.
Yes, now that one came to think of it, they
had <i>always</i> been good friends.</p>

<p>“And was it really thirty thousand a
year? Was it in soap or pork? At any
rate, it was a magnificent match for a penniless
girl!” whispered a married lady to
her partner.</p>

<p>“Of course the old woman was in
the secret all along,” remarked Mrs.
Langrishe to a neighbour; “she is much
cleverer than any of us have supposed.
Oh, what a deep game she has played!
<i>What</i> an old serpent!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br><span class="small">THE SUMMONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the moonlight, bright as day, Mr. Jervis
rode home beside Miss Gordon’s rickshaw.
Her tell-tale fan stuck out of the pocket of
his overcoat.</p>

<p>Yes, their little world was not blind; it
was evidently a settled thing. Most people
were glad. The Brandes were sure to do
the wedding in “style;” and a wedding
would be an agreeable variety from dances
and picnics.</p>

<p>“I shall come up to-morrow morning,”
he said, as he reluctantly released her hand,
“to-morrow before twelve.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brande, who had effected his escape
early, had returned home, and been in bed
and asleep for some hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>He was suddenly aroused by his wife
standing at his bedside, her cloak hanging
off her shoulders, her coiffeur a little
deranged, a lamp in her hand illuminating
an unusually excited countenance.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>what</i> is it?” he demanded with
pardonable irritation.</p>

<p>“Oh, P.! what do you think? A man
has come from Simla——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” suddenly sitting erect, his official
mind at once on the alert for some pressing
and important dispatch.</p>

<p>“He came out with them in the same
ship,” she panted.</p>

<p>Had Sarabella his wife gone suddenly
out of her mind?</p>

<p>“He says that Mark, not Waring, is the
rich man.”</p>

<p>“He said it after supper, I suppose,”
snarled Mr. Brande. “He was <i>drunk</i>!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! I tackled Mark himself,
and he confessed. I was very angry
at being taken in. He declares they did
it without meaning a bit of harm at first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and that when it went too far he did not
know what to do. He is very sorry.”</p>

<p>“That he is a millionaire! Oh yes, I
should think so!”</p>

<p>“He is coming up first thing to-morrow
to tell you all about it; and, unless I’m
mistaken, to speak to you about Honor.”</p>

<p>“What about her?” sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, you dear, stupid man, are you
asleep still? Can’t you guess?”</p>

<p>“You told me that there was nothing of
that sort; in fact,” with an angry laugh,
“that ‘the boy,’ as you called him, was
desperately devoted to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“What stuff!” she ejaculated indignantly.
“He will have thirty thousand a
year! I know that I shall never close an
eye to-night!”</p>

<p>“And are good-naturedly resolved that
I am to keep you in countenance. You
might, I think, have reserved this double-barrelled
forty-pounder for the morning.”</p>

<p>“And that’s all the thanks I get,” she
grumbled, as she slowly trailed away to
her dressing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Just about this very time, Mark Jervis
was smoking a cigarette in his bare sitting-room.
Before him, on the table, lay a
white feather fan and a programme. He
was much too happy to go to bed, he
wanted to sit up and think. His thoughts
were the usual bright ones incident to
love’s young dream, and as he watched the
smoke slowly curling up the air was full
of castles. These beautiful buildings were
somewhat rudely shattered by the entrance
of his bearer—wrapped in a resai, and
looking extremely sleepy—with a letter in
his hand.</p>

<p>“A Pahari brought this for the sahib
three hours ago,” tendering a remarkably
soiled, maltreated envelope.</p>

<p>Of course it was from his father at last.
He tore it open, and this was what it
said—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,</p>

<p>“I am very ill. If you would see
me alive, come. The messenger will guide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
you. I live forty miles out. Lose no
time.</p>

<p class="right">
“Your affectionate father,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">“<span class="smcap">H. Jervis</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The letter was forty-eight hours old.</p>

<p>“Is the messenger here?” he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sahib.”</p>

<p>“Then call up the grey pony syce; tell
him to take gram and a jule, and saddle
the pony. I am going off into the interior.
I must start in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>The bearer blinked incredulously.</p>

<p>“I need not take you.” The bearer’s face
expanded into a grin of intense relief. “I
shall be away several days. Get out my
riding kit, shove some clothes in a bag, and
ask the cook to put up some bread and
meat and things, and tell the coolie I will
be ready very shortly.”</p>

<p>Then he sat down, drew his writing-case
towards him, and began to write a note to
Honor. Her first love letter—and strange,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
but true, <i>his</i> also. It was merely a few
lines to say he had been most suddenly
called away by his father, and hoped that
he would be back within the week.</p>

<p>It was both a keen disappointment and
a keen pleasure to the girl when the ayah
brought the letter to her at nine o’clock.
She read it over and over again, but she
will not allow our profane eyes to see it,
nor can it be stolen, for she carries it about
with her by day, and it rests under her
pillow by night: at the end of the week
it was getting a little frayed.</p>

<p>When the ayah handed the note to the
Miss Sahib, the writer was already twenty
miles out of Shirani, following a broad-shouldered
Gurwali with his head and
shoulders wrapped in the invariable brown
blanket.</p>

<p>Their course was by mountain bridle-paths,
and in an eastern direction; the
scenery was exquisite, but its beauties were
entirely lost upon Jervis, who was picturing
other scenes in his mind’s eye. The road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
crept along the sheer faces of bare precipices,
or plunged suddenly into woody
gorges, or ran along a flat valley, with cultivated
fields and loosely built stone walls.
The further they went, the lovelier grew
the country, the wilder the surroundings.
At twelve o’clock they halted to rest the
grey pony—the messenger’s muscular brown
legs seemed capable of keeping up their
long swinging trot all day. It was four
o’clock in the afternoon when they arrived
at their journey’s end; they abruptly descended
into a flat wooded dale, surrounded
by hills on three sides, sloping away to the
plains on the fourth. A path from the
bridle-road led them into a dense jungle of
high grass, full of cattle, pack ponies, and
mules. Emerging from this, they came to
a wall, along which they kept for about
three hundred yards, and turning a sharp
corner they found themselves outside a
great square yellow house, two stories
high.</p>

<p>It seemed as if it had been bodily transplanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
from England. There was nothing
irregular or picturesque about it—the
windows were in rows, the roof was square
and had a parapet, the sole innovation was
a long verandah, which ran all round the
building, and was apparently of recent date,
a mere after-thought.</p>

<p>Mark, as he rode up to the steps, looked
about him for the coolie; he had suddenly
disappeared. There was no one to be
seen. He ascended to the verandah, it
was deserted, save for some fowl, who
seemed delightfully at home. It was more
the verandah of a native dwelling than the
entrance to the home of an Englishman.</p>

<p>The new-comer gazed around expectantly,
and saw three string charpoys, a
bundle of dirty bedding, a pair of shoes, a
huka, and a turban.</p>

<p>The door, which was innocent of paint
or bells, was ajar. He pushed it open and
found himself in a large, dim, very dirty
hall. Here he was confronted by an old
nanny goat, and two kids; to the left he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
saw a room, which appeared to be a mere
repetition of the verandah.</p>

<p>As he hesitated and looked about, a man
suddenly appeared, a servant presumably,
wearing a huge red turban, and a comfortable
blue cloth coat. He was stout and
well to do, had a fat face, a black square
beard, and remarkably thick lips.</p>

<p>He seemed considerably disconcerted,
when he caught sight of the stranger, but
drawing himself up pronounced the words,
“Durwaza, Bund,” with overwhelming
dignity. Adding in English—</p>

<p>“The sahib never see no one.”</p>

<p>“He will see me,” said Mark, with
decision.</p>

<p>“Sahib sick, sar, seeing no one, those
my orders. Sahib seeing no sahibs for
many years.”</p>

<p>“Well, he sent for me, and I have come.
Let me see him immediately. I am his son.”</p>

<p>The Mahomedan’s expression instantly
changed from lofty condescension to the
most unqualified astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“The sahib’s—son!” he repeated
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have told you that once
already. Look sharp, and send some one to
see after my pony; I have come a long
distance.”</p>

<p>The bearer went away and remained
absent about five minutes, during which
time Mark had leisure to note the dirt,
and neglected, almost ruinous, state of the
house—which had originally been a fine
mansion—to listen to loud jabbering and
whispering in the room beside him, and to
observe several pairs of native eyes eagerly
peeping through a crack in the door.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said the bearer, with
a sullen air. “The sahib will see you
presently.”</p>

<p>“Is he better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is quite well; please to sit
here,” and he opened the door of an
immense dining-room, furnished with
Bombay carved black wood furniture, and
a dusty Indian carpet. It was a room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
that was evidently never used, and but
rarely opened. Its three great long
windows, which were caked and dim with
grime, looked out upon the snows. This
was evidently the back of the house; the
front commanded a view of the plains.
The site had been admirably selected.</p>

<p>A black tray, with cold meat and some
very sour bad bread, was borne in, and a
place cleared on the dusty table by the joint
efforts of the sulky hearer and a khitmaghar,
with a cast in his eye, and the very
leanest figure Mark had ever beheld.
However, he was much too hungry to be
fastidious, and devoured the refreshments
with a capital appetite. Meanwhile, after
their custom, the two men stood by in
silence with folded arms, staring with
concentrated attention and unremitting
gaze until the conclusion of the meal.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the bearer reappeared,
and, throwing open the door,
announced in a deeply resentful tone—</p>

<p>“The sahib will see the sahib.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Mark followed the fat, square, aggressive-looking
back, till he came to a curtained
archway, and was ushered into a lofty dim
room, so dim, that he could barely discern
the figure which rose to greet him—a tall
bent man in a dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“Mark, my boy, it was like you to come
so soon,” said a shaky voice. “Like what
you were as a child,” and he held out both
his hands eagerly.</p>

<p>“I only got your letter at four o’clock
this morning, sir,” said his son. “I hope
you are better?”</p>

<p>“I am for the present. I sent for you
by a private messenger post-haste, because
I believed that I had but a few hours to
live, and I longed desperately to see you.”</p>

<p>“I have been hoping you would send
for me for the last two months. I have
been waiting, as you know, in Shirani.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—yes! Sometimes the temptation
was almost irresistible, but I fought
against it; for why should I cloud over
your young life? However, I had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
choice; the situation has been forced upon
me—and you. My faithful companion,
Osman, died ten days ago, but we will talk
of this another time. These voices in my
head interrupt me; especially that woman’s
voice,” with an irritable gesture.</p>

<p>His son could not, for the life of him,
think of any immediate or appropriate remark,
and sat in embarrassed silence, and
then Major Jervis continued—</p>

<p>“You are six and twenty now—a grown
man, Mark, and speak like a man! I have
not had a good look at your face yet. I
wonder if it is the same face as that of my
own honest-eyed boy?”</p>

<p>The answer would be prompt, if he so
pleased, for the lean khitmaghar now staggered
in under the weight of a large evil-smelling
“argand” lamp (a pattern extinct
everywhere save in remote parts of India).</p>

<p>Mark looked over eagerly at his father.
His head was bent in his hands. Presently
he raised it, and gazed at his son with a look
of unmistakable apprehension. His son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
felt as if he were confronting an utter
stranger; he would never have recognized
this grey-haired cadaverous old man as the
handsome stalwart sabreur he had parted
with sixteen years previously. He looked
seventy years of age. His features were
sharpened as if by constant pain, his colour
was ashen, his hands emaciated, his eyes
sunken; he wore a camel’s-hair dressing-gown,
and a pair of shabby slippers.</p>

<p>“You are just what I expected,” he exclaimed,
after a long pause. “You have
your mother’s eyes; but you are a Jervis.
Of course you see a great change in me?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes—rather,” acquiesced his son,
with reluctant truthfulness. “India ages
people.”</p>

<p>“You think this a strange life that I
lead, I am sure; miles away from my
fellow-countrymen, buried alive, and long
forgotten?”</p>

<p>“No, not forgotten, sir. Do you recollect
Pelham Brande of the Civil Service?
He was asking for you only the other day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“I think I remember him—a clever
fellow, with a very pretty wife, who people
said had been a servant. (How long these
sort of things stick to people’s memories.)
I’ve been out of the world for years.”</p>

<p>“But you will return to it. Come back
to England with me. What is there to
keep you in this country?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed!” with a jarring laugh.
“No, my dear boy, I shall never leave the
Pela Bungalow, as they call it, until I am
carried out of it feet foremost.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say this? You are a
comparatively young man—not more than
fifty-five.”</p>

<p>“I feel a thousand years old; and I
often wish that I was dead.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder! I should say the same,
if I had lived here alone for seven years.
How do you kill time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t kill time. Time is killing me.
I walk in the garden sometimes, but
generally I sit and think. You must be tired,
my boy,” as if struck by a sudden thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I am, I must confess. I was
at a ball until four o’clock this morning.”</p>

<p>“A ball till four o’clock this morning!”
he repeated. “How strange it sounds. It
seems the echo of a voice speaking twenty
years ago!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dinner was served at a small table; a
fowl for Mark, some patent food for Major
Jervis. The cooking was atrocious, the
attendance careless, the appointments
splendid, but grimy. It was the same in
every department—an extraordinary mixture
of squalor and magnificence. It
seemed to the indignant young man that
these ruffians of servants thought anything
good enough for his father.</p>

<p>When Major Jervis’s huka was brought
in he looked over at his son and said—</p>

<p>“You smoke, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks; but not that sort of thing.
I would not know how to work it.”</p>

<p>Last time he had lit a cigarette between
four walls he little guessed at the style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
his next surroundings. The room was not
uncomfortable, the furniture was massively
carved and luxurious, the carpet rich
Persian; there were book-cases full of
volumes, and there were fine pictures on
the walls; but the paper was peeling off
in strips, and cobwebs hung like ropes from
the corners. The books were grimy with
mould, the carpets and curtains inches
deep in dust; certainly a sort of oasis had
been cleared around Major Jervis’s chair,
but everywhere the eye turned were tokens
of neglect, poverty, and decay. His father’s
slippers were in holes, his linen frayed;
apparently he was a poor man. What had
become of the begum’s fortune?</p>

</div>


<p>When Mark Jervis awoke the next morning,
in a totally unfamiliar room, he wondered
if he was dreaming, as he gazed at the
heavy old carved furniture, the faded
window hangings, the curious devotional
pictures, and the little black crucifix and
holy water receptacle at the foot of the bed.
(The Cardozo family had of course been
Catholics.) No, he was not dreaming, but
actually under his father’s roof at last.</p>

<p>As soon as he had dressed, he went out
before breakfast to see after the welfare of
his syce and pony. The yard resembled
that of a serai, it was so full of natives, who
gazed at him inquiringly, as he made his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
way through sheep, goats, buffalo calves,
and children, to the stables, the tumble-down
remains of what had once been an
imposing pile. An old hairy Bhoetia pony
and his own were now the sole occupants.
His syce came to him eagerly, with a face
of pitiful dismay.</p>

<p>“No gram for pony, sahib”—holding up
his hands dramatically. “Never giving
gram here—nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about that—go and buy some”—handing
him rupees.</p>

<p>“Oh, sahib”—now putting his hands
into an attitude of prayer. “Plenty, plenty
Budmashes in this place. Sahib, let us
travel to-day, quickly to Shirani.”</p>

<p>“In a few days, Dum Sing—not yet;
meanwhile take care of yourself and the
pony.” And he walked on to the garden.</p>

<p>The gardens, though somewhat neglected,
were in perfect order in comparison to the
house; they were laid out in stony terraces,
the walls of which were loaded with fruit;
there were flowers and vegetables in abundance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a round fish-pond, several statues,
summer-houses, and a large staff of mallees
working away with surprising zeal. A
broad terrace walk commanded, as you
arrived at one end, the snows, and a grand
panorama of the plains as you reached the
other. A well-worn track was beaten in
the middle of this path, which indicated
that it was a favourite promenade, and at the
end nearest to the plains there was a seat.</p>

<p>Here Mark was joined by his father. He
was dressed in a shrunken Puttoo suit, and
looked frail and feeble, but such a gentleman
in spite of all his shabbiness!</p>

<p>“This is my walk and my seat,” he
explained. “I sit here for hours. That
white line far below is the cart road, and
with a good glass you can make out carts
and tongas; and far away on the plains,
twice a day in clear weather, you can see
the smoke of the train. So I get <i>some</i>
glimpses of the world after all.”</p>

<p>“And how are you off for neighbours,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“My nearest is an American missionary
and doctor; he is twelve miles from here;
and there is a German mission fifteen miles
across that hill”—pointing with a stick.</p>

<p>“And your post? What about your
letters?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want a post; once in six
months or so I send a coolie down to
Ramghur.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t take a daily paper?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; why should I? There are
stacks of old ones about the house,” was
the amazing reply.</p>

<p>“And books?”</p>

<p>“I’m a man of one book. I read the
Indian Army List; that is quite enough
literature for me. Some fellow’s names
alone call up a whole novel.”</p>

<p>“You feel better to-day, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am unusually well. You are not
married, are you?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“No, not yet”—rather startled at the
sudden change of topic. “But I hope to
marry before long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Hope, hope; that’s what we all say.
Don’t let it go beyond that. Hope told a
flattering tale. I don’t believe in hope.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired his companion
rather anxiously.</p>

<p>“You see this terrace,” he exclaimed, as
if he had not heard; “I walk up and down
it exactly a hundred times a day; I take a
hundred beans in my pocket, and put one
of them on that bench every time I come
to it. I find it most interesting; only
sometimes birds steal my beans, and that
puts me out, and I lose count, and I have
to begin the whole hundred over again, and
I get so tired. But I must do it, or they
would be angry.”</p>

<p>“Who would be angry, sir?”</p>

<p>“I forget, just this minute—the beans or
the birds.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have wonderfully fine
fruit-trees here,” said Mark, after an expressively
long silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, the mallees work well, the rascals,
because I give them all the vegetables and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
flowers and fruit, as well as their wages.
They make a good thing out of it; the
peaches and pears and plums from the
Yellow House are celebrated.”</p>

<p>Mark now remembered having heard of
their fame in far Shirani.</p>

<p>“Let us sit down here and talk,” continued
Major Jervis. “For once I will
forego my walk; it is not every day that
I have my son to listen to me. Recent
events seem blurred and dim, but I remember
years back distinctly. Mark, my boy,
shall I tell you something about myself,
and how I have spent my life? Would you
care to know?”</p>

<p>“I would, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then listen to me. You know I am
the younger son of a good old family—Jervis
of Jervis. My father, your grandfather,
was General Vincent Jervis, and—I
can’t tell him <i>that</i>” (aside to himself).
“My family bequeathed me a handsome
profile, an aristocratic type of face, and
something else (but I can’t tell him <i>that</i>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
I married for love, and I can recommend
the experiment. Your mother and I
scrambled along most happily, though I
had always extravagant tastes—inherited,
like my nose and yours. When she died,
I lost my better half indeed—my headpiece,
my best adviser, my all. I drifted back
into my old squandering bachelor ways, and
into debt; but I paid for you to the hour.
Then I came across Miss Cardozo. She
was not very young, but handsome,
pleasant, and rich—she fell in love with
me. I was a good-looking, dashing, devil-may-care
major in a crack native cavalry
regiment. She belonged to this country by
race and taste. There was a good deal of
the begum about her; she hated the idea
of a stepson, and I reluctantly allowed
your uncle to adopt you. I knew you
would be rich and well cared for; but even
then, I struggled against your uncle’s persuasions.
I must have had a presentiment
of these days, when I would be desolate
and alone. I was happy enough with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Mércèdes; we led a gay, roving, extravagant
life. We had plenty of friends, plenty
of spirits, plenty of money. Mércèdes had
no relations, but one, thank God; a greasy-looking
cousin in Calcutta. Lord forgive
me, but I hate him! My wife had a kind,
warm heart, but she was passionate,
excitable—and jealous. She allowed her
feelings too much liberty; she slapped
another woman’s face at a public ball, she
slippered her servants, she ran up huge
bills, and she could never speak the truth.
She actually preferred to tell a lie, even
when she had nothing to gain by it. Can
you imagine such a thing? However, we
have all our faults; and she was a good
soul, though she was not like your mother.
They say a man prefers his first wife, a
woman her second husband—what is your
opinion, eh, Mark?”</p>

<p>“I am not in a position to offer one,” he
answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot—of course not. Well,
eight years ago this very month we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
coming away from Mussouri to our place in
the Doon; we were in the mail tonga, our
ponies were half broken; though we had a
good driver—the best on the road—it was
all he could do to hold them, as they
rattled down with the heavy steel bar,
going clank, clank, clank. Just one mile
out a goat on the cliff dropped suddenly
into the road, the brutes shied wildly
across, the strong wooden railings caught
the side of the tonga, they strained—I hear
them now—snapped, crashed, then there
was a moment’s mad struggle of driver and
ponies—too late, over we went! They
show the place still, I dare say—a drop of
two hundred feet. The ponies were killed,
and the driver and my wife. How I
escaped was a marvel. My leg was broken,
my head cut about, but I survived. Osman,
my orderly, who had been in the old
regiment for twenty years, nursed me, at
Mussouri; and, as soon as I could be moved,
I came here. I remembered it as a retired,
quiet spot, with a charming garden. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
wanted rest; my head was injured, and I
thought I would pull myself together here,
and then go home—but here I am still.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not for much longer,” added
his son, cheerily; “you will come home
with me.”</p>

<p>“Mércèdes’ will was produced,” he proceeded,
calmly ignoring the question;
“she had made it when she was not pleased
with me, seemingly. This place and three
hundred acres are mine, and one thousand
rupees a month for life; also her jewels and
gold ornaments—as much use to me as a
heap of stones. Fernandez receives a fine
income even now. All her wealth accumulates
till my death, and then everything—jewels,
rents, shares—goes to him. He
is my heir. I cannot leave you a penny;
nothing but the old Yellow House.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want the Cardozo money, sir.”</p>

<p>“No; and you will have plenty.
Meanwhile Fuzzil Houssan spends my
income on his relations to the third and
fourth generation, and laughs and grows fat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Surely you do not leave it all in his
hands?” asked his listener incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, most of it. Only for that, I
suppose he would poison me. I believe he
is in Fernandez’ pay—Fernandez, who I
am keeping out of thousands a year.
Occasionally he comes in person to see if
there is any chance of my dying? I have
given him great hopes more than once.
Now that Osman is dead, he and Fuzzil
will certainly hurry me out of the world—and
that speedily.”</p>

<p>“Who was Osman?”</p>

<p>“He was a sowar in my regiment—a
Sikh—we had known each other for half a
lifetime, and he was more to me than
a brother. We joined the same month,
we left the same day. He gave up
home, country, people, and followed my
fortunes, and died in my arms last week.”
Here Major Jervis’s voice became almost
inaudible.</p>

<p>“We had braved heat and snow, fire
and water, together, and in the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
evenings here whilst I smoked my pipe, he
would talk to me by the hour of the old
regiment; such talk is better than any
book. If Osman had lived, I never would
have summoned you—no, never; he stayed
with me till death took him, and you must
remain here till death takes <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> will take you with me,” said his son,
resolutely. “All you have been telling me
shows me that this country is not the place
for you. The sooner you are back in
England, the better; you will come home
with me, will you not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see England,” he
answered peevishly. “India is my country,
it has got into my blood. I have spent my
bright days out here, and here I’ll spend
my dark ones. My days are dark indeed,
but they will soon be over, and so much
the better. And now it is eleven o’clock,”
he said, rising stiffly. “Let us go in to
breakfast.”</p>

<p>After breakfast Major Jervis promptly
disappeared, leaving his guest to wander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
about alone; to wonder at the extraordinary
<i>ménage</i>, the troops of native children,
pattering in and out, the fowl, the goats—who
stumped through the hall as if they
wore boots—the overpowering smell of
huka, the great dreary rooms, piled up with
rotting furniture, saddlery, and carpets.
Among other wrecks, he noticed an old
dandy and a side-saddle—doubtless the
property of the dead Mércèdes.</p>

<p>He strolled about the valley, to the
amazement of the hill people, who stared
at him open-mouthed. How, he asked
himself, was he to pass the long empty
hours till sunset? For the bearer had
condescendingly assured him, that “the
sahib would sleep until then.” He had
taken a violent dislike to fat-cheeked
Fuzzil, who scarcely troubled himself to
obey an order, and had invariably to be
summoned several times before he condescended
to appear. A civil Pahari,
touched by the young sahib’s forlorn and
aimless wanderings, volunteered to guide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
him to the cantonment. “A cantonment
here?” he echoed incredulously, and accepted
the offer with alacrity. A brisk walk
by narrow tracks and goat-paths brought
them to the brow of a hill in a southward
direction, overlooking an abandoned station,
Mark’s guide volubly explaining to him that
thirty years before had been full of gorrah-log
(soldiers) from the plains. There were
the barracks, the bungalows, and gardens,
with trees that bore apples even now! But
the cholera came one year and killed half a
pultoon (regiment) and the rest went away,
and never came back, except once or twice,
so folks said, for “a tamashah.”</p>

<p>“A tamashah—what do you mean?”
asked Jervis, sharply. Was this burly hill
man daring to chaff him?</p>

<p>“Sahibs and mem sahibs—eating, drinking,
and having music and nautches. For
the rest,” with a shrug, “the place was
given over to Bhoots and fiends.”</p>

<p>A wide cart road, grass grown, led into
the deserted cantonment, and Mark followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
it on to the parade ground. There was
the mess-house still habitable, the church
roofless, encircled by a well-filled God’s
acre, kept in perfect order. Here was,
indeed, a most surprising sight, a graveyard
in the wilds, not over-grown or choked
with weeds and bushes, but every stone
and slab free from moss, every grave tended
with reverent care. He went into the old
echoing mess-house, and found it in excellent
repair—thanks to its beams and doors of
deodar wood—as the Pahari proudly pointed
out. There were at least twenty bungalows
standing, half buried among trees and
jungle; with creepers matted down over
their windows; in some the verandahs had
given away, in some the roofs had fallen in,
some, on the other hand, appeared to set
time at defiance. The site was beautifully
chosen, nestling in the lap of the hills, with
a peep of the far-away plains; not a sound
was to be heard save the trickling of a
streamlet, nor a living thing to be seen,
save a few hill cattle, and under a tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
some vultures who were picking the bones
of a dead pony. The condemned cantonment
was, for all its beauty, a melancholy
place. Beyond Haval Ghat, and sloping
towards the plains, were fields of golden
corn, and villages sheltering in clumps of
trees, picturesque bananas waving their
graceful leaves over huts, that with their
comfortable slab roofs resembled English
cottages.</p>

<p>The coolie now explained that he wished
to show his honour yet another sight, and
to guide him home by a different route.</p>

<p>Half an hour’s climbing brought them
to a good-sized street, of carved-fronted,
flat-roofed hill houses. To the stranger’s
horror it seemed to be altogether populated
by lepers—lepers who were old, middle-aged,
young—there were also leper children.
They swarmed out and surrounded the
sahib, exhibiting every form of their hideous
disease, as they clamoured for assistance.
Jervis emptied his pockets of everything
they contained in the shape of money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
dispensed alms hastily, and among the worst
cases, and then hurried away. He felt
heartily ashamed of his feelings of shuddering
repulsion. Supposing he had been
a leper himself—and such things as Englishmen
who were lepers were known to exist.
Still he turned headlong from that awful
village of life in death, and hastily reascended
the hill towards the Pela Kothi.</p>

<p>The desolate cantonment and the leper-colony
combined to depress him beyond
words, although the scenery was unsurpassed,
the air as exhilarating as a tonic,
and the scents and sounds of the forest
enough to stir the most torpid imagination;
nevertheless, Mark Jervis felt as if he had
a load upon his back, as if he had grown
ten years older in the last two days. It
was not merely the scenes of the afternoon
that preyed on his spirits. There was his
father—his mind was undoubtedly shaken—he
must endeavour to get him away, to
take him home; yes, at all costs.</p>

<p>“What a curious way he talked. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
so well and sensibly; sometimes in
such incomprehensible jargon. What did
he mean by saying, ‘Osman stayed here till
death took him. You must remain here
until death takes <i>me</i>’?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br><span class="small">“HEREDITARY.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>His long afternoon rest had revived Major
Jervis; he appeared to be another man as
he sat opposite his son at dinner, and
talked not merely sensibly, but wittily,
across the grimy tablecloth, on which was
exhibited smoked goat-chops and other
undesirable comestibles. He discussed the
condemned cantonment—he recollected its
bygone existence. The lepers—they were
his pensioners, and came for their dole
weekly—they were well looked after between
missionaries and other people. He
spoke of his regiment, his former comrades;
he gave vivid descriptions of shikar expeditions,
of pig-sticking, of thrilling scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
on active service. He related anecdotes of
well-known people of his acquaintance; he
boasted of his brothers-in-arms, and described
a polo tournament as if it had come
off yesterday!</p>

<p>“And you have quite lost sight of all
these friends?” inquired his son, after a
pause.</p>

<p>The question seemed to break a spell; all
animation suddenly faded from the major’s
face, his whole expression changed into that
of a shrunken old man as he replied—</p>

<p>“Yes; I left the herd, like a wounded
deer, seven long years ago. I have hidden
myself from them, and I am entirely forgotten.
People are forgotten out here
sooner, more completely, than in any other
country.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say so?” asked his son,
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Because life is so full; events march
rapidly, changes occur daily. Cholera,
war, accidents, sweep away men—and
memories.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>When the table had been cleared and
cigarettes produced, and Fuzzil and his
satellite had somewhat reluctantly departed,
Major Jervis looked steadily at his companion
for some time, and exclaimed at
last—</p>

<p>“You are very like me, Mark! I can
see it myself; and I was considered a
good-looking fellow. I had a bigger frame,
though; I rode a couple of stone heavier.
But you are a stronger man than your
father; you have a square jaw and a stern
will. You can say <i>no</i>. I never could
get out that word in time—and many
troubles were my lot. You wish me to go
home with you, my boy?”</p>

<p>“I do,” was the laconic and emphatic
reply.</p>

<p>“And I want you to stay with <i>me</i>; you
must remain with me. I have not long to
live. Look at me well.”</p>

<p>Mark glanced at his sunken eyes, his
worn, emaciated features.</p>

<p>“And you must see the last of me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
don’t intend to let you go; no, for once I,
too, can say <i>no</i>.”</p>

<p>“But, nevertheless, I’m afraid you must
let me go, sir, and shortly. I promised
Uncle Dan——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he interrupted with unexpected
passion, “I understand what you would
say; that you would thrust your uncle
down my throat. But, after all, are you not
<i>my</i> son—not his? I reared you until you
were ten years old. When you were a small
child and burning with fever, who was it
that used to walk up and down with you
in his arms for hours? Not your uncle
Dan. Who was it that first set you on the
back of a pony and taught you to sit like
a Bengal sowar? Not your uncle Dan.
Who was it that lifted you out of your
dying mother’s embrace? Not your uncle
Dan. You are my own flesh and blood; in
all the wide world I have now no one but
you. Since Osman died I have not a single
friend. I am surrounded by vampires of
servants. My heir prays on his knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
nightly to his patron saint for the telegram
that will carry the news of my death. I
believe the form is here in Fuzzil’s possession,
filled up, all but the <i>date</i>! I am a
miserable, solitary, dying wretch, and I
appeal to you, my son, to spare me a few
months of your healthy, happy life, and to
stay beside me and protect me. Do I,”
leaning his elbows on the table, and searching
his son’s face intently, “appeal in
vain?”</p>

<p>“You wish me to live here with you
altogether?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” with curt emphasis.</p>

<p>“To give up my uncle?”</p>

<p>“For a time, yes. I seem cruelly selfish,
but I am as a drowning man snatching at
a spar. You <i>will</i> stay?” A tremor ran
through his voice.</p>

<p>“I cannot. No; I promised Uncle Dan
that I would certainly return,” rejoined his
son firmly.</p>

<p>“Your uncle has health, wealth, a wife,
and many friends. Surely he can spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
you to a sick and desolate man. The
Almighty has afflicted me sorely. If you
abandon me to my fate, and gallop back to
your gay life and companions, the day will
come when you will bitterly repent it.
Osman’s burthen has fallen on you, and
will my own son do less for me than an
alien in blood, a Mahomedan in faith, a
poor, unenlightened, faithful sowar?”</p>

<p>And he stretched out his hand, and fixed
an interrogative gaze on his companion.
The paleness of concentrated feeling tinged
the young man’s face, a few drops of sweat
stood on his forehead.</p>

<p>“Mark, what is your answer?” he demanded
in a hoarse whisper. “Be quick.
Say yes or no—yes or no.”</p>

<p>“Not now, sir,” suddenly standing up.
“You must give me time. Give me forty-eight
hours.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there is something more than your
uncle,” with a swift expressive glance;
and he rose and put his hands heavily on
his son’s shoulders. “I know,” gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
straight into his eyes with a mad keenness
in his look, “there is, of course, a <i>woman</i>
in the case?”</p>

<p>“There is,” admitted Mark, holding
himself erect. “An hour before I got your
letter, I had asked a girl to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“And you need not tell me her answer—<i>yes</i>,
of course; young, rich, handsome!
The world is full of women—over-run with
them. A man can have fifty sweethearts,
but he has only one father!”</p>

<p>“There is only one sweetheart in the
world for me,” returned his son proudly.</p>

<p>Major Jervis drew himself up with an
air of formidable dignity, and deliberately
surveyed the speaker in sarcastic silence.
Suddenly his expression changed, and became
charged with fury; he made a frantic
gesture, as if he would sweep both son and
his sweetheart off the face of the earth.
Then he tore back a purdah, beyond which
he instantly disappeared—leaving it quivering
behind him.</p>

<p>After waiting for a quarter of an hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Mark went up to his own room, which he
began to pace from end to end. Presently
he turned down the lamp, flung open the
window, looked out, and drew a long, long
breath. His temples throbbed like engines
in his burning head, every fibre of his being,
every shred of his understanding, was now
engaged in an inner soul-struggle.</p>

<p>On one side was arrayed Honor Gordon,
his good-hearted, indulgent uncle, to whom
he was sincerely attached—friends, wealth,
the life to which he was accustomed—a life
of ease and sunshine. On the other hand,
there was <i>this</i>!—and he gravely surveyed
the dim, weird landscape, the starlit sky,
stretching to the mysterious horizon, and
shuddered—his afflicted, forlorn father, who
would not be removed, and who could not
be abandoned.</p>

<p>His father, who had cared for him in his
childhood. Yes! it was <i>his</i> turn now; and
would he be behind Osman, the Mahomedan,
who had done from love, what he
should do from duty?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“But his father might live years! Was
he a brute to wish him dead? <i>Did</i> he
wish his father dead?” he asked himself
fiercely, and shuddered again. What was
he coming to? Had two days in the jungle
turned him into a beast?</p>

<p>If he accepted what was plainly his duty,
his uncle would cast him off, and he must
renounce Honor Gordon! Was this a home
to bring her to? common sense grimly
demanded. And he would now be penniless
indeed! He was tortured with heart-wearing
doubts and temptations, as duty or
inclination gained the upper hand. Two
nights ago he could not sleep for happiness;
now, he could not rest for misery! He
resolved to walk down this raging fever, to
quell this mental turmoil, by sheer bodily
fatigue. He made his way through the
silent house, where he found all the doors
open, and nearly fell over a goat and two
kids who were dozing in the hall, otherwise
the lower regions were untenanted.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
noise and brilliant light outside; laughing,
loud chattering, and the complacent humming
of dissipated tom-toms! The compound
was illuminated by a large fire, and
half a dozen flaming torches, and crowded
with a mob of natives, who were enjoying,
with intense appreciation, the solemn
gyrations, and shrill high-pitched songs of
a couple of tawdry Nautch girls. The surrounding
go-downs were full of animated
visitors. One was evidently a drinking den,
whilst in another were gamblers. Standing
in the shadow on the steps, unnoticed,
Jervis surveyed these orgies entirely at his
leisure. He distinguished the khitmatghar,
though without a turban, his sleek black
hair parted like a woman’s, and falling over
his shoulders. He was playing cards with
three other men; a bottle and a beaker
stood by for general enjoyment. The
“khit” was absorbed in the game, his
eyes seemed to protrude from his head as
they greedily followed the cards. Meanwhile
Fuzzil was solemnly superintending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the Nautch, and applauding occasionally,
with fitful, tipsy condescension.</p>

<p>A few sharp words from the young sahib,
who appeared among them like a spirit, had
an electrical effect. An awed and immediate
silence was followed by a simultaneous
helter-skelter rush and scurry.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this madness?”
demanded the sahib sternly of Fuzzil, who
with drunken valour stood his ground,
whilst the Nautch girls, tom-toms, and
spectators, melted away like so many
rabbits scuttling to their burrows.</p>

<p>“Madness!” repeated Fuzzil, with an air
of outraged dignity; “it is a grand tamasha
for the marriage of my wife’s brother’s
son. Does the sahib not like Nautches,
and cards, and drink, like other young
sahibs? Of a surety he <i>does</i>”—answering
his own question with insolent emphasis,
and a little stagger. “As for madness;
this house is a poggle-khana” (madhouse).</p>

<p>“What do you mean, you rascal?” said
Jervis, sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Of a truth, all the world know that.
Is the fair-haired sahib, his son, the <i>last</i> to
learn that the old man is mad? Ask the
doctor; ask Cardozo Sahib. Sometimes
for one year he never speaks. Sometimes
bobbery and trying to kill himself; but
Osman took care of him. Now, lo! Osman
is dead; there will be an <i>end</i> soon. This
house will cease to be a poggle-khana, and
all the worthy ‘nouker log’ (servants) can
return to their own country.”</p>

<p>“You, for one, can return to-morrow,”
responded the sahib, in surprisingly fluent
Hindostani.</p>

<p>“You are not the master here,” blustered
Fuzzil, in amazement. “I taking no
orders.”</p>

<p>“You will find that I am; and if you
ever again come into my presence, with
your shoes on your feet, I will thrash you
within an inch of your life. Send away all
these people; tell them the tamasha is
over for to-night; put out the lights, and get
to your go-down, and sleep yourself sober.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Fuzzil stared, swallowed, gasped. The
young man’s resolute air and stern eye
were altogether too much for him, and he
obediently slunk off, without further dispute.</p>

<p>Major Jervis did not appear the next
morning, and his son mounted his pony and
went for a long ride. Where he went he
but vaguely remembered; his thoughts were
far too preoccupied to note his surroundings.
There was no doubt that his father’s mind
was affected; no doubt this was attributable
to the fall over the khud, and injury
to his head. The vital question remained
to be decided, was he, Mark Jervis, to
sacrifice his youth to filial duty?—one
would soon grow old in the Yellow Kothi—to
renounce friends, fortune, sweetheart,
to lead a semi-savage existence, entirely
cut off from what is called Life.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if he set his
pony’s head for Shirani, and returned to
Honor, to all the delights of the world,
would not the recollection of the miserable
father he had abandoned to strangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
poison every pleasure, and force itself into
every joy?</p>

<p>“But to live there”—and he drew rein
and gazed down upon the square house,
standing out distinctly against a blue,
purplish background—“will be,” he exclaimed
aloud, “a living death. Like a
vain young fool, I wanted a chance to do
something—some special task, some heroic
deed, that would set me apart from other
men; but, God knows, I never thought of
<i>this</i>!”</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he rode
up to the verandah, and was amazed to
meet a coolie leading away a steaming-hot
hill pony—a hired animal—and more surprised
still to discover a visitor comfortably
established in a long chair, with his fat legs
elevated above his head, enjoying a peg and
a cheroot. Evidently there was no occasion
to ask him to make himself at home! The
stranger slowly put down his feet and stood
on them, when he first caught sight of Mark.</p>

<p>After staring hard for a few seconds, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
said, with an air of great affability, “I am
Fernandez Cardozo, and you are Major
Jervis’s son—my cousin.”</p>

<p>“I am Major Jervis’s son,” assented the
young man, stiffly; and he, in turn, critically
surveyed his father’s heir. He was
low-sized, fleshy, and swarthy, about forty
years of age; he had a closely cropped
bullet head, sprinkled with grey hairs,
a round good-natured face, a pair of
merry black eyes, and a large mouthful of
flashing white teeth. An Eurasian, and
possibly not a bad sort of fellow, was
Mark’s verdict.</p>

<p>The other was thinking, “What a fine
young man! Quite tip-top. How strange
it seemed that he should be the son of the
poor, crazy old major inside.” And his eyes
travelled over his smart country-bred pony,
his English saddlery, his well-cut boots and
clothes.</p>

<p>“Yes—you are his son,” he said at last,
“but I am his <i>heir</i>. We are, son and heir,”
and he laughed—an oily laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“You are heir of course to Mrs. Cardozo—I
mean Mrs. Jervis’s fortune. Won’t
you sit down?”</p>

<p>“You have not been long here, have
you?” now reseating himself.</p>

<p>“No; only two or three days.”</p>

<p>“And how,” with a jerk of his thumb in
the direction of the major’s apartments,
“do you find the old man?”</p>

<p>“Well, I never knew until now, that his
mind was rather—affected. He has not
written to me for years, and I only got his
address with difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he prefers to lie low—as Mr.
Jones. But ‘<i>rather</i> affected,’ is putting it
mildly.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” considering Cardozo
with a pair of hostile eyes.</p>

<p>“You will think so too before long.
Now don’t be vexed with me, my dear boy.
No one is ever angry with Ferdy Cardozo,
they know I am a good fellow, and that I
mean well. Shall we go inside and see if
there is anything to be had to eat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly, I ought to have thought of
it before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t apologize, I’m quite at
home. Fuzzil, you fat lazy swine,” to the
now obsequious bearer, “get me something
to eat, none of your dogs’ food—such
as brain cutlets or Irish stew, and bring up
some of <i>my</i> wine. It’s very hot in here,
awfully frousty,” opening a window. “The
major hates me like poison, and when he
hears I’m in the house he won’t come out,
he will go to ground like a snake, but I
shall be off to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Are you in the army?” continued
Fernandez with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>“No, I am not in the regular army; I’m
in the yeomanry.”</p>

<p>“No profession then?” raising his
arched brows in rather supercilious surprise.</p>

<p>“No, not any.” His profession as heir
to his Uncle Dan, would soon be a thing of
the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Cardozo’s surmise was perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
correct. Major Jervis did not appear, he
merely sent his salaams and dined in his
own apartments, leaving his son and his
heir to consume that meal <i>tête-à-tête</i>. It
was a great improvement on the usual
<i>menu</i>. Evidently Fuzzil had resources
that he drew upon on worthy occasions.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine moonlight night,” remarked
Fernandez. “Let us go and smoke in
front of the house, it’s better than being
indoors, and I like to make the most of the
hill air when I’m up, and we are out of the
way of eavesdroppers.”</p>

<p>In a few moments they were sitting on
the low wall in front of the Pela Kothi.</p>

<p>“Osman was a desperate loss,” began
Fernandez as he struck a fuzee—“a
desperate loss.”</p>

<p>“So I gather from what I hear,” assented
his companion.</p>

<p>“That’s partly what brought me up. I
have business round here, of course, though.
I live in Calcutta. I like to keep my eye
on the property, and I look after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
major and manage his affairs as well as I
can—I feel it my duty.” And he began to
smoke.</p>

<p>Was here yet another man, of no kin to
Major Jervis, who was to put his own flesh
and blood to shame?</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me something
about my father—the last seven years are
a sealed page to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, first of all he got a fall on his
head pig-sticking, and that made him rather
foggy for a bit, he saw everything double.
Then of course the tonga business was a
finisher. Osman brought him here, and at
times he was perfectly well, as sane as you
or I, and interested in the garden, and the
news, and all that, but he got worse by
degrees, fits of silence and depression,
never opening his lips for maybe a whole
year—melancholy, suicidal mania—tried to
hang himself with a stirrup leather, you
understand,” lowering his voice expressly.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i>—I—understand,” acquiesced the
other, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“He must have some one always with
him, more or less. Some one whom he
likes, and who has influence and a strong
will, such as Osman—he was invaluable.
I don’t know how we are to find a substitute
for him,” continued Fernandez
thoughtfully, as he crossed his legs, leant
his elbow on his knees, and puffed
meditatively.</p>

<p>“The servants he has about him now
must be shunted,” said Mark, emphatically.
“I never saw such a pack! They had a
feast and tom-toms last night. They are
lazy, insolent, useless blackguards!”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” agreed Fernandez,
cheerfully. “And Fuzzil will retire a rich
man, keep a gharry, and send his sons to
college. They come here fairly decent
servants—but the desperately dull life, no
bazaar, no other ‘nauker log’ to bukh with,
is a want no wages can repay. Then the
household has no head, no regular hours,
and so they all do as they please and go to
the bad. I don’t know what is to be done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
now—your father won’t allow a stranger
near him. The question is, Who is to
replace Osman? Tell me that”—and he
flung out his hand with a dramatic gesture.</p>

<p>“I will replace Osman,” was the totally
unexpected reply.</p>

<p>“You!” cried Cardozo, gazing at the
speaker with round-eyed incredulity. The
young man’s face was pallid, his lips set
hard. “You don’t know what you are
saying”—and he took his cheroot out of
his mouth and continued to stare at his
companion exhaustively. “You are accustomed
to the big world of London; you
have seen and done what I have only read
about—for I have never been home; you
are accustomed to a whirl of society, to
novelty, excitement, luxuries, and immense
wealth. <i>You</i> to live here? Upon my word,
excuse me, my dear fellow, the very <i>idea</i>
makes me laugh. Even I, born and bred in
the country, would go mad in a very short
time. I could not stand the life for more
than a week—a month would kill me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“I am not so easily killed as you imagine.
I am tougher than you think,” rejoined
Jervis.</p>

<p>“But you do not know what you would
have to endure”—throwing out his arms
excitedly. “The solitude, the silence, day
after day, exactly the same—breakfast, tiffin,
dinner, bed—nothing to do, nothing to hope
for, no one to see, except the hill-folk or a
missionary. I tell you that you would do
one of two things—either cut your throat,
or take to drink.”</p>

<p>“Your eloquence is a loss to the bar,
Cardozo.”</p>

<p>“So I have often been told”—with a
hasty movement of his hand; “but it is
not a question now of my eloquence, but of
your future. Do you generally mean what
you say? Do you intend to live here as
your father’s sole companion?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied the young man, answering
his look with eyes full of indomitable fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Cardozo puffed away in solemn silence
for some time, but there was a certain brisk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
cheerfulness in his air as he suddenly
remarked—</p>

<p>“The major is going downhill rapidly,
poor old chap! His health is bad; I see a
great change in him. His mind will never
recover. Of course <i>that</i> is not to be expected;
you know that it runs in the
family—it is hereditary.”</p>

<p>“What runs in the family? What is
hereditary?” demanded the other, with a
look full of pain and excitement.</p>

<p>“Insanity. He told Mércèdes, who told
me, that his brother jumped overboard at
sea, going home in charge of two keepers;
and his father died in Richmond lunatic
asylum.”</p>

<p>“Is—this—true?” Mark brought out
the words in three quick gasps.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you never
knew? Oh, I’m awfully vexed! I entirely
forgot you were his son. You look so
different, upon my word, as you stand
there, that I cannot realize that he is
anything to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Jervis struggled to articulate again, but
signally failed. With a shaking hand he
tossed his cigarette over the parapet, and
then walked away up the steps, and was
instantly merged in the gloom of the
entrance.</p>

<p>“Hereditary.” The word seemed written
before him in letters of flame—“hereditary.”</p>

</div>


<p>When it became known at the club, and
subsequently all over Shirani, that young
Jervis had suddenly disappeared the night
of the bachelors’ ball, great was the sensation.</p>

<p>No, no, there was no suspicion of foul
play; there were his servants to be questioned.
Jan Mahomed, his respectable,
grey-bearded attendant, had declared that
the night his master had come home, he
had got straight from his evening clothes
into his riding things, and had taken the
grey pony and galloped away into the darkness.
Whither? How could he say? holding
out a pair of lean, empty hands, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
gesture of pitiable ignorance. He made no
mention of the letter; for this prudent
retainer had lived with bachelor sahibs
before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe and Lalla were for once
agreed. They were convinced that Mr.
Jervis had gone further than he had intended
with Miss Gordon, and to repair the
error, had subsequently put miles between
them—was probably by this time on blue
water. But they did not venture to air
this opinion openly; it was reserved for
“ladies only.” Major Langrishe had
laughed it to scorn; and as for Toby Joy,
he and Lalla almost had a quarrel on the
subject—their very first quarrel.</p>

<p>“Jervis to propose to a girl, and then
run away!” he cried indignantly. “About
the last fellow in Shirani to do such a mean
trick. Jervis is a gentleman to the soles
of his boots, and a real good chap, worth
fifty of Waring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so we all learn <i>now</i>, when it’s rather
late in the day,” retorted Lalla, sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“You mean about the money! But I
mean in other ways. He took it awfully
well the day I nearly smashed up him and
Mrs. Sladen; you saw that yourself! He
certainly lay low with regard to the fact of
his being wealthy. He is the least ostentatious
fellow I ever met, and as straight
as a die, a complete contrast to the great
Clarence, who has been playing the deuce
up at Simla, by all accounts, and making
ducks and drakes of any quantity of coin.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least, we know <i>where</i> he is,
and <i>what</i> he is doing!” retorted Lalla.
“But no one can say the same of the
cousin. Where is he, and what is <i>he</i> doing?
He was always very close about himself,
and I consider the whole thing most suspicious.
Supposing a man proposed for
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, supposing a man proposed for
you,” repeated Toby, edging nearer to the
lady.</p>

<p>“And I accepted him. Now, don’t look
so utterly idiotic, for mercy’s sake! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
he simply took to his heels and ran away,
would I not think that peculiar conduct?
I must say Honor Gordon takes it better
than I should, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“How soon are you going to get rid
of that fellow Gloster?” inquired Toby
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Sir Gloster was bringing a tedious convalescence
to an end, and taking daily
airings in Mrs. Langrishe’s rickshaw; and
people, who were disappointed of a wedding
in one quarter, were eagerly expecting to
hear of one in another.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” coquettishly. “Perhaps
I may <i>never</i> get rid of him!”</p>

<p>“You know you only say that to make
me wretched. You don’t really mean it,
do you?” pleaded Toby, with such a look
of misery on his usually merry face, that
Miss Paske burst into an uncontrollable
scream of laughter, and said—</p>

<p>“Toby, how can you be so exquisitely
silly?”</p>

<p>The few days Mark Jervis had written of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
had grown into ten, and he had almost
slipped out of people’s minds, save when
a string of ponies being led along by their
syces, and wearing smart jhools, with the
initials M. J., brought him momentarily to
remembrance.</p>

<p>And now Captain Waring suddenly reappeared.
He came direct from Simla,
back to despised Shirani, and in anything
but his usual cheery spirits. How he had
cursed his coolies and ponies on the way
up! What a life the <i>débonnaire</i> Clarence
had led his miserable servants, as if the
poor wretches were responsible for his discomfiture,
his bad luck, his ruin, for it had
come to that—and it was a desperate man,
who spurred his distressed country-bred
pony up the last two miles of the dusty
cart road.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find Haddon Hall
tenantless; but when the bearer explained
how “a Pahari had brought a note, and his
master had gone ‘ek dum,’” <i>i.e.</i> on the
spot, he nodded his head sagaciously, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
appeared to understand all about it. What
he could not comprehend was Mark’s
prolonged absence. “Ten days gone,”
Mahomed said; “two days, were he in
Mark’s shoes, would be amply sufficient
time to devote to his eccentric parent.”</p>

<p>Clarence was in a bad plight, and almost
at the end of his resources, which had
hitherto been as unfailing as the widow’s
cruse. He had gambled recklessly, with
stronger men than himself; he had thrown
good money after bad, in the usual wild
attempt to recover both. His I.O.U.’s and
debts of honour and lottery accounts came
to a large total; he would be posted in a
few days if he did not pay up. As to other
debts, they were legion—shop bills, club
and mess accounts, wages—they poured
down on him in all directions, ever since
that little brute Binks had peached at
Simla and spoiled everything. Miss Potter
had bitterly upbraided him, and subsequently
snubbed him unmistakably; the
men at the club looked coldly on him; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
high players in the card-room had seemed
stiff and curiously averse to his “cutting
in.” People suddenly stopped talking when
he joined them; yes, he was at a crisis in
his life, a crisis brought on by his own
insane recklessness, and raging passion for
play. He had come expressly to Shirani to
get Mark to assist him; if he failed him, if
he refused to stretch out a hand, and drag
him back from the gulf of insolvency and
disgrace, on the brink of which he tottered,
down he must go, and be swept away and
swallowed up, among the thousands and
thousands who have similarly gone under!</p>

<p>After a bath, a meal, and a smoke,
Captain Waring felt better, and set to
work to think things out steadily, and
to pull himself together. He had sold his
own ponies and guns, their price was a
sop to his most urgent creditors. He
would now proceed to dispose of Mark’s
battery. Yes, they were fine weapons—he
would put them and the ponies on the
notice board at the club at once—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
price of them would pay their passages
and immediate expenses; Mark’s £500
would cover all debts; he had not a rupee
left at the agent’s, and he would make
Mark come home at once. It was true
that their year’s leave had yet four months
to run, this was the middle of June, but
he had made India too hot to hold him for
the second time. The sooner he set about
winding up affairs the better, and he rose
on the spur of the moment, resolved to cast
an eye over his cousin’s saleable effects.</p>

<p>He went into Jervis’s room, the smaller
and worst of the bedrooms, and very
plainly furnished. There was a bare camp
bed, a rickety chest of drawers, a washed-out
dhurrie on the floor, also a long row
of boots; a couple of saddles on a stand,
and a first-rate battery of guns—“a double-barrel
central-fire breach-loader, by Purdy,
that will fetch 250 rupees; a 500 express,
by Lancaster, 400 rupees; 8-bore rifle, 600
rupees; rook rifle, 100—say, 1300 rupees,”
was his mental calculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>When he had examined these, a parcel
on the chest of drawers arrested his
attention; there was also a programme.
He took it up and looked it over; he was
extremely inquisitive in such small matters.
The card was full, and opposite three
dances were scribbled the initials “H. G.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” he muttered aloud. “So
<i>that</i> is going on!” And as his gaze
travelled to a ladylike parcel in silver
paper—“What the dickens is <i>this</i>?”</p>

<p>He promptly unrolled it, and beheld a
most superior white ostrich feather-fan,
with the monogram H. G. on the handle.
Captain Waring unfurled it, fanned himself
slowly, folded it up once more, and
said—</p>

<p>“A feather shows how the wind blows,
Mark my boy! Well, I’ll go over to the
club and hear what is going on, look up
the mail steamers, and offer your ponies
and rifles, my fine fellow. You will have
to come home with me sooner than you
think, and I’ll get great kudos from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
uncle for carrying you off from a dangerous
entanglement—in other words, from H. G.”</p>

<p>And Captain Waring sauntered out to
the stables in a surprisingly good humour.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry he has got the grey with
him!” he muttered to himself; “the grey
is a long way the best of the three! The
grey is worth five hundred rupees.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, the grey, carrying his
owner, arrived home that same day about
four o’clock, much to the bearer’s joy. His
master spent the afternoon packing, making
arrangements, giving orders, writing letters.
He announced that he was going away
again the next morning, and Jan Mahomed
and his son were to follow with all his
baggage. In future he would live with his
father near Ramghur.</p>

<p>Jan Mahomed received this astounding
piece of information in the usual native
fashion, merely with a stolid face and a
long salaam.</p>

<p>Yes, his choice was made, the die cast,
to Major Jervis’s intense satisfaction, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to Fernandez Cardozo’s intense amazement.
The former had been ill, and had detained
his son from an earlier return to Haddon
Hall to wind up his affairs, and open his
letters, the latter including one from his
uncle, which had been lying on the writing-table
for a whole week. It said—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mark</span>,</p>

<p>“Yours received, and I answer it
within the <i>hour</i>. I note all you say about
the young lady, and I don’t like the idea
<i>at all</i>. My boy, you know I have never
refused you anything, but I must say <i>no</i>
to this. I have only your welfare at heart.
I cannot allow you to throw yourself away
on an ordinary Indian spin. You are right
to tell me all about it; and, as you have
not yet proposed for her, <i>don’t</i>. You must
marry some pretty, well-born girl, who has
never been through the Suez Canal. Come
home immediately; these idle days in a
hill station have had a bad effect on your
steady brain. Come home as soon as ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
you can. Your father has evidently become
naturalized; he does not want you—<i>I do</i>.
As for the girl, you might give her a pony,
or a diamond brooch—anything—everything,
but yourself.</p>

<p class="right">
“Your affectionate uncle,<br>
“<span class="smcap">D. Pollitt</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>As Mark looked up from this letter he
met the scrutinizing black eyes of Jan
Mahomed which were fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>“This sahib has been ill,” he said,
severely. “Jungle fever getting?”</p>

<p>“No, Jan, I am all right. This is the
day the English dak goes out, and I want
you to take a letter to the post for me, it
will be ready in twenty minutes, and send
word to the Captain Sahib, that I have
come back.”</p>

<p>Then he drew his writing-case towards
him and began a letter to his uncle.
Evidently this letter was not an easy
composition, in fact, he had already written
it several times at Ramghur, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
instantly destroyed it, but it must be
written somehow, and <i>now</i>. The post left
within the hour. At length he wrote—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle Dan</span>,</p>

<p>“Since I last wrote to you I have
been with my father; he sent for me suddenly,
and I went off the same hour, as his
note said that he was very ill. I found him
living forty miles from this, in an isolated
house, part of the Cardozo property, and
under the name of Mr. Jones—a name he
has adopted for the last seven years. I
never would have recognized him, he is so
broken down, and quite an infirm old man.
This is the effect of the accident that killed
his wife. But this is not the worst. His
mind is deranged, which accounts for his
strange silence and many other things. At
times, such as at the present moment, he is
perfectly clear and collected, but at others
he suffers from depression and melancholia,
and sits silent for days and weeks. He is
alive to his own infirmity, and that is why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
he has chosen this life of seclusion. Until
recently he had one of his former sowars
living with him, an invaluable companion;
and now that he is dead—an irreparable
loss—Uncle Dan, I am going to tell you
something that will be a shock, as well as
displeasing, to you—I am about to take the
place of this faithful servant, and endeavour
to be his substitute. My father is a forlorn
and stricken man; he has no one but me to
look to—he does look to me, and I will not
fail him. He is not wealthy—the begum’s
riches, Mrs. Jervis’s fortune (minus a certain
annuity), is strictly reserved for her next of
kin, Fernandez Cardozo. He is not a bad
sort, and has been looking after my father
and his affairs—in short, fulfilling <i>my</i> duty;
but I shall relieve him of all this, and
remain out here as long as my father lives.
I am afraid that at first you will think I am
treating you badly and ungratefully; but
this I know, that, were <i>you</i> in my place,
you would do the same yourself. Of course
I forfeit all claim on you by such a step as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
I am about to take, and it is a step which
has cost a struggle. I am going to lead a
different life to that to which I have been
brought up. I shall be isolated and out of
the world, for I can never leave my father
even for a day. Once I take up my post, I
shall stick to it.</p>

<p>“I have found your letter here awaiting
me—your letter about Miss Gordon. Of
course that is all at an end now. As for
her not being good enough for me, it is the
other way about. She is the only girl I
ever cared for. I shall never marry now,
but will adopt the profession I chose as a
child, and live and die a bachelor. I wonder
that I can joke, for I need hardly tell you
that I am not in a merry mood. I feel as
if everything had gone from me at one
blow, and I am left face to face with a new
life and an inflexible duty. Whatever you
may think of me, Uncle Dan, my feelings
towards you will never change; I shall
always think of you with affection and
gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Clarence came back to-day from Simla.
I have not seen him as yet. I only arrived
a couple of hours ago, to collect my kit,
dismiss my servants, and say good-bye to
Miss Gordon. If you had ever seen her,
and spoken to her, you would not have
written that suggestion about a pony or a
brooch. I go back to Ramghur to-morrow.
My lot is not likely to be a very bright one;
do not make it harder, Uncle Dan, by being
implacable. I know that at first you will
feel certain that you never <i>can</i> forgive me,
but you will by-and-by. Write to me and
send me papers to care of Mr. Jones,
Ramghur, <i>viâ</i> Shirani. You may as well
take my name off the clubs, sell the horses
down at the farm, and tell Windover not to
put the drag in hand.</p>

</div>

<p>This letter, hastily written, with numerous
erasures, the writer did not trust himself
to read over, but thrust it into an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
envelope, addressed and despatched it on
the spot, as if he almost feared that he
might be tempted to recall it, and change
his mind.</p>

</div>


<p>“Hullo, Mark!” cried his travelling companion,
with cordial, outstretched hands.
“So you are back? I only arrived this
morning—came straight through from
Simla. What’s the matter, eh? You seem
rather choop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll tell you presently. Let us
have your news first.”</p>

<p>“On the principle of keeping the best for
the last, eh? for mine is <i>bad</i>. Well, as for
news”—removing his cap and sitting down—“I
suppose you have heard that our
secret is now public property. That blatant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
ass, little Binks, had it all over Simla.
What business had <i>he</i> to thrust himself
into our private affairs?”</p>

<p>“It was never what you would call
private,” rejoined Mark, who was leaning
against the end of a real old-fashioned hill
sofa, with his hands in his pockets. “I
am only surprised that it never came out
before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, now that you mention it, so am I.
We had a good many fellow-passengers, but
they none of them came up this way; they
were mostly for Burmah, or Madras, or
globe-trotters. I could not give the name
of one of them if I got a thousand pounds.
There is nothing one forgets so soon as a
fellow-passenger. Of course you have been
to see your governor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve been away nearly a fortnight.”</p>

<p>“And how did you find him?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say very broken down—ill
and desolate.”</p>

<p>“But with sacks of gold mohurs all round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the rooms, and chandeliers of real diamonds.
I hope you have some in your pockets?”
said Waring, gaily.</p>

<p>“No. He is a comparatively poor man;
at least he has just enough to live upon—an
annuity. The bulk of his fortune goes,
as it ought to go, to the Cardozo family.”</p>

<p>“Well, one fortune is enough for you,”
rejoined Clarence. “I came up post haste.
I rode your bay pony in the last ten miles,
and, by Jove! I thought I had killed him.
It was frightfully hot, and I put on the
pace. I gave him a whole bottle of whisky
when I got in.”</p>

<p>“A whole bottle! Well, I hope you
will give him some soda-water to-morrow
morning. What a head the poor brute will
have!” he added, with a wintry smile.
“But what was the reason for such desperate
riding? Has Miss Potter come
back?”</p>

<p>“Miss Potter be hanged!” was the unchivalrous
reply. “I came up as hard as
I could lay leg to the ground to get you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
help me out of an awful hole—an infernal
money muddle.”</p>

<p>“To help you again! I thought that
five hundred pounds would put you straight.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, man! it’s not hundreds,
but thousands that would do that!” cried
the prodigal.</p>

<p>Jervis ceased to lounge, and now assumed
a more uncompromising attitude.</p>

<p>“Explain,” he said laconically.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve been going it, my boy,”
admitted Waring, with a reckless laugh.
“Old faces, old places, were too much for
me, and I dropped a pot of money. There
was a fellow from New Orleans, a long-headed
chap, a born gambler, and a wild-looking
Hungarian count; they carried too
many guns for me. One night we had
three thousand pounds on the turn of a
card. Ah, that is living! There is excitement,
if you like! Better twenty hours
of Simla than a cycle of Shirani.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless you have returned to
Shirani?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, only because I am cleared out,”
was the absolutely unabashed reply.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear it, Clarence; but it is
not in my power to help you beyond the
five hundred pounds that will pay our
expenses here. The table was papered
with bills when I came back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those!” with a gesture of scorn,
“rubbishy little shoeing accounts, stable
accounts, and rent. I don’t mind <i>them</i>, it’s
others. I’m really in an awful hat this time
and no mistake, and you must assist me.”</p>

<p>“I cannot.”</p>

<p>“I tell you again that you must!” cried
Waring, throwing himself back in his chair,
with an energy that made that venerable
piece of furniture creak most piteously.</p>

<p>“There is no ‘must’ in the matter,”
retorted the other steadily, “and if I were
in the humour for joking—which I am not—the
comic side of the situation would
make me laugh. You were sent out by
Uncle Dan as my mentor, to keep me
straight, to give me the benefit of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
experience and to show me round. Wasn’t
that the arrangement? But, by Jove,”
suddenly springing up and beginning to
pace the room, “I have been lugging you
out of scrapes ever since we landed in the
country!”</p>

<p>“It is a true bill, oh wise, cool-headed,
and most virtuous Saint Mark! This, I
most solemnly swear to you, is my last and
worst scrape. Get me a cheque for a
certain sum, wire to the uncle to lodge it
at the agents, and I’ll be a truly reformed
character, and never touch another card,
for ever and ever, amen.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Afterwards we will reward the old man,
and rejoice his heart, by packing up and
going home by the next steamer. He
would give many thousand pounds to get
you back again—you are the apple of his
little pig’s eye. This country does not
agree with me—I don’t mean physically,
but morally. It’s an enervating, corrupting,
beguiling land. We will sell off your guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
and ponies, dear boy. I’ve put them up
at the club—I hope I have not broken the
wind of that dark bay—we will go down
in the mail tonga this day week, <i>en route</i>
for Bombay. There are temptations for
<i>you</i> in this Indian Empire too. The sooner
you say good-bye to H. G. the better. Now,
there is my programme for you—my new
leaf. What have you to say to it?”</p>

<p>Brisk and confident as his speech had
been, there was a certain unmistakable
lameness in its conclusion. Waring had
secretly winced under his listener’s eyes—his
listener, who sat motionless, contemplating
him with an expression of cool
contempt.</p>

<p>“The first thing I have to say is, that
my guns and the ponies are not for sale,
or only the chestnut with the white legs.”</p>

<p>“Great Scot! You don’t mean to tell
me that you intend to take three ponies
home! And what do you want with an
express rifle and an elephant gun in
England?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“I may require them out here. I am
not going back to England.”</p>

<p>Captain Waring sat suddenly erect.</p>

<p>“Of course this is all humbug and rot!”
he exclaimed vehemently.</p>

<p>“No. I am quite in earnest. I intend
to remain with my father; it is the right
thing for me to do. He is alone in the
world; his mind is weak.”</p>

<p>“So is his son’s, I should say,” burst
out Waring, throwing his cigarette into
the verandah. “Get him a keeper—two
keepers, by all means; a baby house, a
barrel organ, every comfort, but don’t <i>you</i>
be a lunatic. Come home with me. Think
of Uncle Dan!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know very well that Uncle Dan
will cast me off; he told me he would, if
I remained out here with my father.”</p>

<p>“Cast you off!” almost screamed the
other. “Do you mean to tell me that
you will never see the colour of his money
again?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“I believe that Miss Gordon has something
to say to this scheme, as well as this
mad Quixotic idea about your father,” cried
Clarence, crimson with excitement. “As
for the girl, you must let her slide, we have
all been through <i>that</i>; but, for God’s sake,
hang on to the uncle, and the coin. You
are the only mortal for whom he will open
his purse-strings.”</p>

<p>“I have written to him, and told him
that I am not going home.”</p>

<p>“Is the letter posted?”</p>

<p>Mark nodded.</p>

<p>“Then,” turning on him fiercely, “you
have burnt your boats.”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“You are mad to chuck everything at
twenty-six years of age. You give up your
life at home——”</p>

<p>“I know best what I am giving up,”
interrupted his companion impatiently. “I
know that I am going back to Hawal Ghât
to-morrow. There is nothing to be gained
by remaining on here, and Cardozo is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
staying with my father till I relieve him.
I am winding up my affairs, and paying
off my servants, except Jan Mahomed, and
his son, who are coming with me, and to-morrow
I turn my back upon Shirani.”</p>

<p>“Short—sharp—and decisive is the
word,” sneered Waring, with bitter emphasis.
“Have you got over your good-byes
yet?” he added, with pitiless
significance.</p>

<p>“No,” becoming rather white, “not
yet.”</p>

<p>“I was told at the club that you were
engaged to her. Is <i>she</i> to form part of
the new scheme? Will marrying her also
come under the head of the ‘right thing
to do?’ Eh?”</p>

<p>“You may spare your gibes,” said Jervis,
sternly. “Miss Gordon is absolutely free.
As for myself—I shall never marry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” with a derisive laugh,
“never is a long word. Well, to descend
to more prosaic matters, what about these
Shirani bills and that five hundred?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“You shall have it, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are a man of your word, even
if it is a question of a thrashing. I’ll never
forget the day that the cad who was ill-using
a horse on the towing-path riled you
and taunted you; he got hold of the wrong
man that time, and no mistake, poor beggar.
He never guessed how you could use your
fists. You looked so slim and genteel,
but you left him with two lovely black
eyes.”</p>

<p>Mark made a gesture of protest. Time
was precious. What was the use of raking
up irrelevant old stories?</p>

<p>“Can’t you draw upon the uncle for
a couple of thousand, at least?” urged
Waring, after a considerable silence; “it
will be no more to him than a couple of
pence—and will save me from—from——”</p>

<p>“What?” asked his companion quietly.</p>

<p>“From,” avoiding his penetrating eye,
“a lot of bother and worry.”</p>

<p>“I cannot draw on him now for a penny,
beyond the five hundred; but I am sure he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
will help you when you see him. How
soon are you going home?”</p>

<p>“In a week. Hullo!” starting up,
“there is the mess bugle. Are you coming
over to dinner?”</p>

<p>“No; tell the mess sergeant to send me
something.”</p>

<p>“Any champagne? I’d recommend a
bottle of the pink wine of France. You are
bound to see things more <i>couleur de rose</i>.”</p>

<p>Jervis shook his head with an air of
impatient negation.</p>

<p>“Well, I must go and change; but I’ll
look you up again, of course, before you
turn in.”</p>

<p>Clarence proved as good as his word;
besides, he had as yet to receive a certain
sum of money. He duly appeared about
eleven o’clock, unusually flushed, and in a
state of boisterous good humour. He found
his former comrade still sitting at their
joint writing-table, scribbling notes and
servants’ chits.</p>

<p>“You look as if you were making out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
your last will and testament. Writing
your own obituary notice, eh, old chappie?”—slapping
him familiarly on the back.
“In one sense you <i>are</i> committing suicide,
and burying yourself alive. I’ve sold your
chestnut pony, and got the cheque—two
fifty rupees—dirt cheap.”</p>

<p>“It will go towards paying off some of
these,” said Mark, nodding at the bills.</p>

<p>“Oh, a mere drop in the ocean,” rejoined
Clarence, with easy scorn. “However, we
can’t have our cake and eat it,” ignoring
the fact that it was he who had devoured
not only his own cake, but the other man’s
as well.</p>

<p>“Here is the cheque for five hundred
pounds,” said Mark, producing his cheque-book.
“I told Uncle Dan I was going to
draw it some time ago, so it will be all
right”—writing rapidly and handing it
over. “It will clear all bills here—mess,
rent, and shops; or”—still retaining it—
“shall <i>I</i> keep it and pay them? I can
send the money by post.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Waring glanced at the slip of paper held
towards him. His eyes blazed with a
curious light; his voice was husky as he
eagerly answered, “No, no; you may rely
on me. I’ll be paymaster to the very end
of the chapter,” and he seized upon the
cheque somewhat precipitately.</p>

<p>“And you will not make any other use
of it than paying off our joint debts? You
will promise me that, Clarence?” speaking
with an air of cool authority. “On your
honour, Waring?”</p>

<p>“On my word and honour. What do
you take me for, old man? I’ll get it
cashed at the treasury here, pay all the
bills like a gentleman, and send you the
receipts. I hope that will please you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will do, of course; and mind
you settle them at once.”</p>

<p>“I hear old Double Gloster and Miss
Paske are engaged,” said Clarence, hastily
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“Are they?” indifferently. What was
Shirani news to him now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“And there is not a road in India wide
enough for Aunt Ida. Well, Mark, I am
sorry you are so headstrong. You were
always a bit hard in the mouth, though you
never kicked over the traces. You’ve been
a brick, I must say. What time are you
off to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“About seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll say good night. You
look pretty fagged, and you had better turn
in. This”—nodding—“is not good-bye;
I’ll make a point of seeing you in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mark stood erect, and held
out his hand in silence.</p>

<p>How pale he looked; how worn and
haggard he had become! Clarence intuitively
felt that this was their last interview;
something indefinable assured him
that they would never again stand face to face.</p>

<p>He was conscious of an extraordinary
mixture of regret and relief. Jervis had
represented a sort of conscience. His example,
his disagreeably rigorous standard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
honour, his steady eyes, had shamed him
from doing many things that he ought not
to have done. Mark was a young saint, a
hero; yes, Miss Valpy was right, he had
the face of one. It was the act of a hero to
renounce the world, wealth, and love—occasionally
synonymous with the flesh and the
devil—and devote his life to a crazy old
man. He was a cool, reliable comrade,
ready with tongue, arm, or rifle. It was
true that he had been the means of pulling
him out of several nasty scrapes, and this
cheque for five hundred pounds, now in
his waistcoat pocket, would pull him out of
the worst scrape of all!</p>

<p>He waited until he saw Mark go into
his room and close the door, and then he
slipped back to the club to play “snookers”
and black pool. He was not home until
three o’clock in the morning; and when he
awoke about noon, and shouted for his
bearer and his tea, he was informed that
the “chotah sahib,” as the servants called
Jervis, “had been gone many hours.”</p>

</div>


<p>It was about eight o’clock in the morning,
and Mrs. Brande, as she put the last
touches to her toilet, was certain that she
heard a man’s (a gentleman’s) voice in the
verandah. Pelham was from home; who
could it be at such an hour? Some one
come for “Chotah Hazree.” Well, Honor
would look after him! Ten minutes later
she came out, flourishing in her hand a
freshly unfolded handkerchief, and gave
quite a little gasp of pleasure as she
recognized Mark Jervis. He was leaning
against the stone pillar of the verandah
talking earnestly to her niece, and his pony
was waiting at the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I do declare, this <i>is</i> a pleasure,”
she cried; “a sight for sore eyes! Where
have you been hiding yourself this ten
days?”</p>

<p>But somehow her exuberant delight was
instantly quenched, when she caught sight
of the faces of the two young people. Mark
looked strangely agitated and as if he had
but just recovered from some all but mortal
sickness. Honor, her bright, happy Honor,
was as smileless and white as death.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said Jervis, advancing
with an outstretched hand, “to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, dear!” waving away his
salute. “You have not said, ‘How do you
do?’ to me yet!”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid I am very stupid to-day.
I don’t intend to have any secrets from you,
Mrs. Brande.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know your secret, so does every
one,” nodding. “I think you might have
given us a <i>little</i> hint.”</p>

<p>“You mean about the money; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
would have done so only my hands were
tied.”</p>

<p>“And your cunning cousin never let
on!”</p>

<p>“No, but that is not what I have to tell
you——”</p>

<p>“Then come into the drawing-room and
sit down like a Christian, and send the pony
round.”</p>

<p>He shook his head emphatically as he
said, “I can only wait a short time. I am
going off now to a place forty miles away,
to live with my father.”</p>

<p>“Your father!” she repeated, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, my uncle adopted me when my
father married again. My father is Major
Jervis, he has lived in these hills for some
years. I never knew his whereabouts until
recently. The night of the ball he sent
for me, he believed that he was dying, and I
went off at once—I found him very ill, and
quite alone and desolate. I am going to
keep him company for the rest of his days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
You see, he has no one in the world
belonging to him but me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” said Mrs. Brande,
after a pause. “It is awfully good of you,
that I will say; but if you are your uncle’s
adopted son, how will <i>he</i> take it?”</p>

<p>“Badly, I am afraid, but I cannot be in
two places; my uncle has a wife, and heaps
of friends, and money, and first rate
health.”</p>

<p>“Make your father come in to Shirani;
we will put him up; and why not get him
to go home?”</p>

<p>“It would be of no use to urge him to
either step; he is a fixture in his present
home for as long as he lives.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least you will often come in
and see us—<i>you</i> are not a fixture!” she
urged eagerly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brande, you are very good—I
shall never forget all your kindness to me—but
as far as I can see, I shall never come
back to Shirani again. My father could
not spare me, for one thing—and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
another,” and there was a ring of passion
in his voice as he added, “I could not
endure it. Think of me, as companion to
an invalid, with every moment occupied,”
and here his words sounded a little husky.
“Do not tempt me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mark, my boy, I am so sorry!”
she exclaimed; “to think that this is good-bye—that
we shall not see you again.”</p>

<p>Mark told himself that this so-called
underbred, vulgar woman had accepted
the news of the shattering of her niece’s
fortune in a manner that no duchess could
have surpassed. Apparently it was not
the loss of position, of thousands a year,
that had cut her up—she had stood that
with marvellous stoicism—it was the loss
of Mark himself!</p>

<p>“You know, of course, what my hopes
were,” he said, glancing towards Honor,
who stood at the far end of the verandah,
gazing out at what—? “There is an end
to them now. Some explanation is due
to you and Mr. Brande, and I will write.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
She need never know <i>all</i>. Let people in
Shirani suppose what they please, as long
as it does not reflect on <i>her</i>. Our engagement
was never given out—it was a mere
matter of hours. My father is peculiar,
he wishes to keep his name and existence
a secret—you will understand all—later
on.”</p>

<p>“I remember him well,” said Mrs.
Brande; “such a handsome fellow, and
so fond of society, and so popular. His
second wife—I have seen her—a dark
person, with——Well, she is dead; let her
rest. Oh, Mark, I suppose this must be.
But is there not some way out of this
trouble, some loophole, some alternative?
Surely you would not sacrifice my poor
Honor and yourself for nothing?” And
her still pretty blue eyes swam in tears.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Brande, you may rely on me
in that. To hold to Honor—I give up
Honor. May she come as far as the gate
with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she may, to be sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“And give me something—you have no
photograph, I know—just to show that we
part friends?” And he looked at her
appealingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande, who had been crying,
deliberately wiped her eyes, and threw both
her arms round his neck and kissed him.
It was no mere playful threat this time!
The dirzee, who had just arrived, and was
slowly unfolding his mat, could hardly
believe his senses. He told the scandal
in the bazaar that evening, and was laughed
to scorn for his pains!</p>

<p>The young couple, closely followed by
syce and pony, walked slowly to the gate;
ay, and up the road.</p>

<p>“I little thought how I should next see
you, and what I should have to tell you,
when we last parted at this very gate,” he
said at last.</p>

<p>“You are giving up a fortune and great
prospects, I know, Mark, because you find
your duty lies out here; you are giving up
the world and going into banishment. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Mark, I prepare you, that I am going to say
something”—with a catch of her breath—“that
may lower me in your eyes; still I
will venture. Surely you need not give up
<i>me</i>. Please”—speaking forcibly—“hear my
reasons. I am accustomed to a very quiet
life at home. I was brought up in poverty;
I shall make a capital poor man’s wife. You
say your father’s affairs are in a fearful
muddle, and that he has but an annuity. I
can nurse him, read to him, walk out with
him, and amuse him; I will be very good to
your father. I don’t want society, or new
dresses, or anything, or any one—but you,
Mark. I know that I am shamefully bold
and unmaidenly—it would kill Mrs. Grundy
to hear me—but I believe you think that I
shall mind your dull, lonely jungle life;
that I shrink from poverty. You are quite
mistaken; I shall enjoy it with you. Do
not say ‘No,’ Mark, even if we must wait.
I am ready to wait—ten, twenty years—thirty
years,” concluded this reckless young
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>She was waiting now for his answer,
white and trembling from the force of her
own emotion.</p>

<p>“Honor, I know you will pity me,” he
began at last, “pity me, when I tell you
that I must say ‘No.’ I must face this life
alone. God bless you, and give you a
double share of happiness—your own, and
what might have been mine. I have lately
learnt something”—and his pale face grew
ashy grey—“that will prevent my ever
calling any woman ‘wife.’ The sacrifice I
am bound to make is bitter; yes, bitter as
death. I am not going to sacrifice you;
you must forget me, darling. You have all
your young life before you; put me out of
your mind—gradually, sorrowfully, tenderly—as
if I was dead.”</p>

<p>“I shall never do that, Mark. Tell me;
may I write to you?”</p>

<p>“No!” was the most unexpected and
chilling reply.</p>

<p>“But yes, as your sister?” she pleaded,
boldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I could never come to think of you as
my sister.”</p>

<p>“At least you will give me your address?
Once, we were to have spent our lives
together; now, I may not even know where
I am to think of you as spending yours.”</p>

<p>“You had much better not think of me
at all,” he answered, with a tremor in his
voice.</p>

<p>“I must, and I shall. Be quick and tell
me.”</p>

<p>“My father calls himself Mr. Jones; he
lives beyond Hawal Ghât, about forty
miles away, and I must be with him before
dark. By-the-by, I have kept your fan;
it may seem an odd notion, but you will
understand. And now I must go.”</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of clattering hoofs and
gay laughing voices rapidly approaching,
he held her hand in his but for one second
and dropped it. Then the syce hurrying
forward with the pony, he mounted and
galloped off. No—he never looked back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Honor stood for a moment as in a sort
of trance; then she turned and leaned
against the palings, which bordered a pine-forest
sloping to the road. The gay riding
party cantering past, rather wondered to
see Miss Gordon without her hat, evidently
looking for something in the wood. They
had no time to stop and ask her what it
was that she had lost?</p>

<p>They would have been rather astonished
if they could have learnt the truth—that
she had just that moment lost her lover,—and
for ever. They might have guessed
at a tragedy of the kind, had they seen her
white set face, and the expression of the
clenched hands that grasped the palings.
But they did not see, nor did they suspect
any connection between Miss Gordon
looking into a wood, and a momentary
vision of a young fellow on a bay pony,
who had flashed up a side path, before they
could identify either man or beast.</p>

<p>Honor, with a perfectly colourless face,
walked up to her aunt, who was still softly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
sobbing in the drawing-room, and leaning
her hand upon her shoulder, said in a
strange emotionless voice—</p>

<p>“It is all over, auntie. We have said
good-bye for ever.”</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed her, and went
and shut herself up in her own room, from
which she did not emerge for several hours;
and then the girl who did appear was a
different Honor Gordon.</p>

</div>


<p>“I never expected to see you again,” cried
Fernandez, as with a napkin over his arm,
and a lamp held above his round black
head, he surveyed Jervis, who was stiffly
dismounting from his pony.</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired the traveller, as
he came up the steps.</p>

<p>“<i>Every</i> why not, my dear fellow. If I
had been in your shoes, you’d never have
seen <i>me</i> again. I’d have taken my <i>jawab</i>.
You are a young man in a thousand.”
And he patted him affectionately on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Not at all”—following him into the
dining-room, where the remains of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
excellent repast was on the table—“I’m
simply a young man of my word.”</p>

<p>Fernandez may have belied himself, but
the chances were that his own estimate of
his character was correct. There is much
in heredity! He came of an easy-going,
voluptuous, volatile stock, as his soft fat
face, loose mouth, and merry but unsteady
eye indicated. His companion was descended
from another and stronger nation;
his character was cast in a sterner mould;
he was the scion of a race of soldiers, who
had fought, suffered, and died for a cause.
Jervis’s square jaw, resolute glance, and
firmly-cut thin lips, told a tale of where the
flesh had warred against the spirit, and had
<i>not</i> prevailed.</p>

<p>“How is my father?” he asked, ere he
seated himself.</p>

<p>“Perfectly well—that is, his mind. He
has been looking for you all day with the
spy-glass. He was tired and went to bed
early. He said he knew you would be here
by morning. If you <i>had</i> deserted him, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
don’t know how it would have been”—touching
his forehead significantly.</p>

<p>Fernandez gesticulated incessantly with
a pair of small, plump, delicately shaped
hands, on which flashed rings of great
value, and of which he was equally proud.</p>

<p>He played the part of host to the son of
the house, anxiously pressed him to eat
dainties, and drink champagne, and was
exceedingly loquacious and confidential.
The pale and worn-looking traveller ate
but little, and supported his share of conversation
by monosyllables, whilst Mr.
Cardozo discoursed volubly of his late
cousin, and threw a somewhat lurid light
upon her married life.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Mércèdes was very generous
and hospitable, and not bad looking—no,
when she did not disfigure herself with a
mask of pearl powder; but she was frightfully
extravagant, as intriguing as her
grandmother, and as jealous as”—immediate
words failed him for a simile, and after
a considerable pause, he added—“the devil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
No, the poor major had his own troubles.
He might not speak to another woman; he
was handsome and popular, and had a
taking manner; he could not help that.
But she made some awful scenes.”</p>

<p>“Did she?” returned Jervis, with the
provoking indifference of a young man to
whom domestic “scenes” are merely a
figure of speech.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a great deal to be said in
favour of the zenana system,” continued
Fernandez, solemnly. “There are no open
scandals, no hysterics at balls, no slapping
of other ladies at dinner-parties, no making
a man look small before his comrades.
Mércèdes took good care never to look
small herself. She always rented the
biggest bungalow in a station, and had it
coloured outside to suit her taste—it was
generally pink-and-white, like a Christmas
cake! She kept open house and about fifty
servants. She liked to sit behind four
spanking horses—the major was a capital
whip. And as to her diamonds—why, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
blazed like a catherine-wheel. She left all
the jewels to the major for life, as a
mockery, for they are no use to him, he
cannot sell a stone; but I can, and will,
by-and-by. The native jewels are worth
lakhs. Most of them are in the bank at
Calcutta; but there are a few here in a
safe—jewelled daggers, horse pistols, gold
battle-axes, betel-boxes. There is one
emerald and ruby necklace, with pearl
tassels, that is worth fifty thousand rupees,
and a sirpesh or forehead ornament, set
with huge rubies, said to have belonged
to Ahmed, the last native conqueror of
India——”</p>

<p>These descriptions were rolling off Fernandez’
fluent tongue, when it occurred
to him that he was speaking to deaf ears.
What would rouse this odd, abstracted
young man—the mention of money?</p>

<p>“The jewels, I see, do not interest you,”
he exclaimed; “but I must tell you something
about your father’s income.”</p>

<p>The abstracted young man turned a pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of steady eyes on the descendant of a
Portuguese free lance and nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Mércèdes made her will in a tantrum;
she had made and revoked dozens. However,
as she was suddenly cut off, this one
had to stand. She left me, her sole heir,
a fine present income—<i>everything</i> at your
father’s death. He has a thousand pounds
a year as long as he lives, or until he
marries, and up till now the money is
thrown away and wasted; it goes to blood-suckers
and hangers-on in hundreds—to
every one but the owner. When he has
one of his bad attacks, he will draw a
cheque for the asking. Unprincipled
tradespeople have sent in accounts for
articles that have never come here. There
are, however, four hundred military saddles
in one of the lumber-rooms, and about nine
hundred pairs of long jack-boots. He
raises a regiment, you see, when he is not
in one of his melancholy fits. A great
deal of money sticks to Fuzzil’s greasy
palms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“So I should suppose; but that is over.”</p>

<p>“There is a leper village chiefly supported
by the major in his lucid intervals.
The beggars and lepers assemble on Sunday
for their alms. It is a great charity.”</p>

<p>“Yes; which is more than we can say
for Fuzzil”—with a mechanical smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I am off to-morrow; my wife is
expecting me,” continued Cardozo, briskly.</p>

<p>“Then you are married!” exclaimed the
other, with unqualified surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t look it, do I? But I
married when I was eighteen—the more fool
I!—to a pretty little girl you could almost
blow away. Yes; and now she weighs
sixteen stone. She has very bad health,
and seldom goes out, though I keep a fine
carriage and horses for her. She does not
care for anything much, as long as she has
her priest, her doctor, her woman cronies,
who tell her all the gossip, and her coffee.
Oh, she is very particular about her coffee.
She is not fond of clothes, or jewellery, or
show; indeed, poor woman, she is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
unwieldy to dress and go about. Now, <i>I</i>
am a society man;” and he threw himself
back with a smile of extravagant superiority.
“I go round looking after the property,
I run up to Mussouri often, I have plenty
of friends. I do a little betting, I play
billiards, I am passionately fond of dancing.
I appreciate a good dinner and a pretty
woman—and pretty women appreciate <i>me</i>.
Oh yes!”</p>

<p>He half closed his eyes, and puffed and
blinked alternately, with an air of ineffable
content. It was all that his <i>vis-à-vis</i> could
do to keep his countenance; indeed, he was
not entirely successful.</p>

<p>“Oh, you may laugh!” exclaimed Mr.
Cardozo, with perfect good humour.
“Other men laugh, too; but <i>I</i> win—I
walk in,” he concluded, with an air of
superb complacency.</p>

<p>Mark gazed dispassionately at his little
stout, sleek companion. He was fat and
forty, effeminate and vain; but then he
was wealthy and good-natured. Were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
these the traits that appeal most strongly
to women-kind?</p>

<p>“I am a great ladies’ man, I do assure
you. I could show you letters——”</p>

<p>Jervis made a gesture of frantic dissent.</p>

<p>“Bah, bah, bah! Why, you know very
well you’ve had fifty love affairs <i>yourself</i>.”</p>

<p>“If I had I should keep them to myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s a snub”—with a roar of
laughter. “And you <i>would</i>; you are a
close sort of fellow, I should say. Now,
I am not; I like talking about my
experiences.”</p>

<p>“With Mrs. Cardozo, of course.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cardozo knows there is no harm
in <i>me</i>; but I must have my own friends,
just as she has hers.” And he stretched
out his arm and amorously contemplated
a slender gold bangle. “I suppose”—with
a self-conscious smile—“you don’t possess
one?”</p>

<p>“Great aunt! I should think not. Do
you wear a necklace, too?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cardozo, who was certainly the soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of good humour, burst into another roar of
laughter; and Fuzzil, who was listening at
the door, reported that “the Kala Sahib
and the other were talking like brothers.”</p>

<p>“Well, well; enjoy life while you may—that’s
<i>my</i> motto.” And he drank off a
bumper of Madeira and smacked his lips
audibly. “You need not be shocked; I
shall take the best care of Maria as long as
she lives, and when she dies I shall marry
again—probably a young girl.”</p>

<p>Mark offered no comment, none being
required.</p>

<p>“Yes, I enjoy life. And you; what will
you do here? Wait”—with a dramatic
gesture—“I will answer my own question.
Either this”—holding a glass to his lips—“or
this”—drawing his hand significantly
across his throat.</p>

<p>“My hands will be full,” rejoined the
other resolutely. “I intend to work great
reforms. I shall manage the domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
budget; I shall get rid of Fuzzil and his
clan.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho! you will just as easily get
rid of the sun, moon, and stars. He is a
fixture; he has been here for years. His
brother is khitmatgar; his father is cook;
his uncle is dhobie. Oh, Fuzzil has struck
in his roots; he knows when he is well off.”</p>

<p>“And I know when we are <i>not</i> well off.
He is a gambling, drunken, insolent ruffian.
Rooted, you say! I shall turn him out,
root <i>and</i> branch.”</p>

<p>“You will be very strong if you do that,”
rejoined Fernandez, looking between his
eyelashes at the spare, stern-faced young
man across the table, who continued—</p>

<p>“I will depend on you to send me up a
decent cook. I shall put my bearer at the
head of the staff; his son will attend my
father.”</p>

<p>“They will rob you, of course,” remarked
Cardozo, with a shrug.</p>

<p>“I doubt it. But if they do, it will be
in a quiet and respectable manner—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
indecently and extravagantly—and to no
great extent. The money will pass through
my hands. The mallees must learn that
they will no longer receive a garden rent
free, and wages for working for themselves.
We will have some new furniture, the
house cleaned and routed out, a daily dâk,
papers, books, a pony for my father.”</p>

<p>“You will never do all this—never. I
wish you every success, you know”—nodding
towards him—“but the labours
of Hercules, the cleaning of the Augean
stables, were a mere joke to your task.
Come, now, I’m a sporting fellow; I bet
you fifty rupees to twenty, that when I
come back in a couple of months’ time, just
to see if you are alive, I shall find our
friend Fuzzil and the goats, old hags,
children, and chickens, <i>in statu quo</i>.”</p>

<p>Jervis shook his head; he was not in the
mood to bet or joke. Life was real, life
was earnest—grim earnest, with him now.</p>

<p>“Well, ta-ta! it is nearly twelve o’clock,
and I have to make an early start,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Mr. Cardozo, rising, and with a yawn that
seemed to divide his head in two parts, he
waved a valediction with his pet hand and
ring, and swaggered off to bed.</p>

<p>But Mark Jervis was of stronger stuff
than flabby, emotional, self-indulgent Fernandez;
and after a desperate struggle he
carried out his plans. The desperate
struggle being on the part of his father’s
good-for-nothing retinue. When in one
brief sentence he informed Fuzzil that he
no longer required his services, Fuzzil
looked as if he could not credit his ears.
He blew out his fat cheeks, and struck an
attitude of defiance, as with folded arms
and head on one side he said—</p>

<p>“You not my master. I take no
orders.”</p>

<p>“I am your master now,” said Jervis.</p>

<p>“I never going. This Mr. Cardozo’s
house.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I think he would be surprised
to hear that; and you will find that
you are mistaken. You have made a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
good business out of this situation. Your
time is up, and you clear out to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mahomed, the bearer, and his following
arrived, and a grand transformation scene
ensued. Some old women in the compound
and stabling had to be carried out bodily,
shrieking vociferously, with their beds and
cooking things and other luggage—the
collection of years of thieving—like so
many magpies’ nests. Fuzzil himself had
also to be assisted off the premises, being
extremely drunk, his turban askew, and
uttering wild cries of vengeance, with
spluttering, foaming mouth. And then the
new <i>régime</i> came into working order. The
house underwent a consolidated spring
cleaning; sun and air were admitted to
dusty old locked-up rooms—rooms that
offered many surprises in the shape of their
contents; a mixture of the properties of
East and West—old howdahs and silver
horse-trappings, rusty swords and spears,
images of saints, holy water stands, crucifixes,
pictures, tulwars, bonnets, betel-nut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
boxes, hookahs, armour. It was, in fact,
a combination of a native “tosha-khana,”
or wardrobe room—an oratory and a pawnbroker’s
shop.</p>

<p>Dust, and dirt, and cobwebs were swept
out, as well as goats, and kids, and poultry.
House linen, glass, and crockery, and carpets
were replaced—money and the telegraph
wires can do great things—walls were
white-washed, windows cleaned, jungle cut
down. Thus was order and energy infused
into every department. The “Pela Kothi,”
though shabby, was neat and cheerful.
The meals were good, and served by snowy-clad
servants; flowers and fruit were
actually to be seen on the table. There
was a daily post, books, magazines, and a
steady hill pony to carry Major Jervis.
But he preferred to hobble on his son’s
arm a hundred times up and down the
terrace, talking of old times, and noting
each turn with a bean. He was a different
man already, roused at any rate for the
moment from his stupor; he took an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
interest in the news of the day, in the
garden, and, above all, in his pensioners,
the lepers.</p>

<p>The young reformer, who had been the
means of all these changes, had worked
hard, worked ceaselessly from morning till
night. He felt that incessant occupation
was his only refuge; he dared not give
himself time to think. He walked over
the hills of an afternoon, when his day’s
work was done, walked until he was so
completely worn out that he was safe to
sleep like a log, and, above all, safe from
what he most dreaded—dreams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br><span class="small">THE VOICE IN THE CONDEMNED CANTONMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The condemned cantonment had an extraordinary
fascination for Mark Jervis, and he
frequently made a considerable detour, in
order to return home by the path that led
through this beautiful but melancholy spot.
The world had abandoned it for a good
reason—he had abandoned the world for
a good reason, they had something in
common in their isolation. He was
familiar with the barracks, the mess-house,
the ruinous bungalows, their wild tangled
gardens, where flower and tree fought
desperately against extinction by savage
cousins and distant wild relations. Apple
and rose trees still managed to hold their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
own, but heliotrope and geraniums had
long succumbed. The churchyard was his
constant haunt, he knew the names and
short histories on the grave-stones, head-stones,
crosses, and not a few immense
square tombs, such as appear to be peculiar
to old Indian cemeteries. It was as if
a small house, or mortuary chapel, had
been reared over the departed, and the
more sincerely mourned, the larger loomed
these great dark weather-stained erections!
There was a big and stately edifice dedicated
to the memory of Constance Herbert, aged
nineteen. What had poor Constance done
to deserve to be weighted down with so
many tons of masonry? The inscription
was effaced. There was another sarcophagus,
erected over the remains of a man
who was killed by a fall from a precipice;
and a tomb, the size of an ordinary gate
lodge, was raised to the memory of an infant
aged eighteen months.</p>

<p>One evening Mark descended the hill
after a long and very erratic tramp; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the hour of sunset; he stood for a few
moments a captive to the influence of his
surroundings—the bluish hills, the amethyst-tinted
distance, the quiet smokeless
bungalows, nestling among their flower-choked
verandahs, the soft yellow light
flooding the entire valley, the uncanny
silence, a silence befitting this forsaken
spot.</p>

<p>He sat down on the grass-grown chabootra
(or band-stand), drew out and lit a cheroot.
It was Sunday, and he instinctively glanced
over at the roofless church. What had been
the last service held between its walls?
A service for the burial of the dead, no
doubt—the long-forgotten dead, who were
buried in its precincts. As he sat there
alone in the midst of dumb witnesses of
the past, his mind travelled back over his
whole life, and he steadily reviewed its
most memorable incidents one by one;
the most noteworthy of all had befallen
him in these very mountains. His thoughts
dwelt on his uncle, then on Honor Gordon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
What was she doing just now? Perhaps
she was sitting in church, listening attentively
to one of Mr. Paul’s brief and
excellent sermons. Had her thoughts,
or prayers, ever strayed to him? Was
it true what Miss Paske had said about
woman’s thoughts? Could he honestly
tell his own heart that he hoped Honor
Gordon had forgotten him? Would he
prefer to be what the Bible terms “a dead
man, out of mind?”</p>

<p>The sun had drawn away his bright
warm cloak foot by foot, the grey pall
of a short Indian twilight was rapidly
spreading over the valley. Shadows
advanced stealthily and momentarily, the
woods were inscrutable, and the first cry
of the jackal rose through the sharp
hill air.</p>

<p>Jervis had risen already to depart, when
his attention was arrested by an unexpected
sound—no jackal this, it was a voice, a
human voice—coming from the direction
of the church or churchyard. He almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
held his breath to listen, and this is what
he heard, in what had been once a full rich
contralto. Every syllable was distinctly
audible, and there was a slight almost
imperceptible pause between each word—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, where shall rest be found—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rest for the weary soul?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twere vain the ocean’s depths to sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or pierce to either pole.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a silence of a full minute,
during which the young man’s heart
thumped loudly against his ribs. Was he
listening to the voice of one risen from
the grave?</p>

<p>Then the weird singing recommenced,
with a wail of passionate despair in the
notes—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The world can never give</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The bliss for which we sigh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis not the whole of life to live,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor all of death to die.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He waited for a considerable time in
a fever of thrilling expectancy—but there
was no more. Having made certain of
this, his next move was to acquaint himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
with the personality of the performer. He
ran over to the ruins of the church, climbed
in across a pile of broken masonry—the
small square enclosure was easily measured
at one glance—it was empty.</p>

<p>Then he walked slowly round, and examined
the walls by the dying light. No,
his quest was vain, there was not a soul—undoubtedly
it had been a soul—to be seen.
In the gathering darkness, the now silent
valley had grown very sombre, the trees
made awful shadows, and the forest seemed
to stretch away up the mountains, until
it was lost in the dusky sky.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“In what direction did you ride to-day,
Mark?” inquired his father as they sat
over their dessert.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you precisely, sir; but I
came home by the cantonment.”</p>

<p>“A lovely spot; the authorities could not
have chosen better, if they had searched
five hundred miles—good air, good water,
good aspect; and yet the last regiment died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
there like flies. The natives say it is an
accursed place, and not a man of them will
go near it after sundown.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t believe in that sort
of thing, sir; you are not superstitious?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” indignantly. “Mércèdes was
superstitious enough for fifty; she had all
the native superstitions at her finger-ends,
and the European ones to boot! There
was very little scope left between the two!
Almost everything you said, or did, or saw,
or wore, was bound to have a meaning, or
to be an omen, or to bring bad luck. I
remember she was reluctant to start from
Mussouri the day she met her death, simply
because she found a porcupine’s quill upon
the doorstep! I have seen some queer
things in my day,” continued Major Jervis.
“When we were quartered at Ameroo I got
a fright that I did not recover from for
months. I had lost my way out pig-sticking,
and was coming back alone, pretty
late. At one part of the road I had to pass
a large irregular strip of water, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
standing upright in the middle of it was
actually a <i>skeleton</i>, swaying slowly to and
fro; I shall never forget that blood-curdling
sight—and I don’t know how I got home,
to this very day.”</p>

<p>“And how was it accounted for?”</p>

<p>“By perfectly natural causes, of course!
Cholera had broken out at a village close
to where I saw the spectre, and the people
had died in such numbers that there was
no time for the usual funeral pyre. It was
as much as those spared could do to bring
the corpse to the spot, tie a gurrah (those
large water vessels) to head and feet, fill
them with water, push the body out, and
then turn and fly almost before it could
sink out of sight! My ghost was one of
these bodies. The gurrah from the head
had broken away, and that at the feet had
pulled the corpse into an upright position,
and there it was, a spectacle to turn a
man’s brain! We were quartered at Ameroo
for four years, and I never passed that
miserable spot without a shudder. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
last saw it the water lay low, covered with
the usual reddish-looking Indian water-weed;
down by the edge was a skull
blackening in the sun. That hideous pool
was the grave of two hundred people.”</p>

<p>“And so your ghost was accounted for
and explained away,” said Mark. “Did
you ever come across anything, in all your
years out here, that could <i>not</i> be accounted
for or explained away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did; a queer, senseless, insignificant
little fact, as stubborn as the rest of
its tribe. One morning many years ago I
was out pigeon-shooting with some fellows,
and we came upon a large peepul tree,
among the branches of which waved sundry
dirty little red-and-white flags, and under
its shade was a chabootra, about fifteen feet
square, and raised three feet off the ground.
Mounting this, in spite of the protest of a
fakir, we discovered a round hole in the
centre, and looking down, we perceived
filthy water, covered with most unwholesome-looking
scum. The sides of the well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
were hollow and uneven and had a sort of
petrified appearance. We asked the reason
of the signs of “poojah” we beheld, and
heard the simple story of the water in the
well. It never increased or decreased, no
matter if the weather were hot and dry, or
cold and wet; no matter whether rain fell
in torrents, or the land was parched with
drought, whether sugar-cane juice or the
blood of the sacrificial goat was poured in
by buckets full, or not at all. It might be
closely watched, to show that it was not
regulated by human hands, and it would be
seen that it never changed. Therefore it
was holy. The god “Devi” was supposed
to be responsible for the curious phenomenon
of the water always standing at the same
level—about four feet from the mouth of the
well, and never increasing its depth—said
to be thirty feet. Over and over again I revisited
the spot, so did others—and we never
discovered any change. That was a fact we
could not explain. All the same, I do not
believe in the supernatural!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>As his father did not believe in the supernatural
and was likely to be a sceptical
listener, Mark resolved to keep his experience
to himself; perhaps there might be a
natural cause for <i>it</i> too.</p>

<p>The arrival of a visitor to the Yellow
House was not lost upon the neighbourhood;
several young planters flocked down to look
him up, and discussed fruit crops, tea crops,
and the best beats for gurool, the best
rivers and lakes for mahseer, and gave him
hearty invitations to their respective bungalows.
The German missionary sought him
out, also Mr. Burgess the American doctor
and padré, who worked among the lepers.
He, like his predecessors, had been struck
with the remarkable and almost magical
change that had been wrought in and
around the Pela Kothi. He beheld his
patient, Major Jervis, in a comfortable airy
room, dressed in a neat new suit, reading a
recent <i>Pioneer</i> like a sane man. Like a
sane man, he discussed politics, local topics,
and with greater enthusiasm his son, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
unfortunately was not at home. Presently
an excellent tiffin was served to the visitor,
he was conducted round the garden, and as
he noted the improvements in every department,
he came to the conclusion that
Jervis, junior, must be a remarkable individual.
He had an opportunity of judging
of him personally before he left, for he rode
up just as Mr. Burgess was taking his
departure, regretted that he had not arrived
sooner, and calling for another pony,
volunteered to accompany the reverend
guest part of the way home.</p>

<p>A spare resolute-looking young fellow
and a capital rider, noted Mr. Burgess, as
Mark’s young pony performed a series of
antics all the way down the path in front
of his own sober and elderly animal.</p>

<p>“Your father is wonderfully better. I
am his medical adviser, you know,” said
the missionary.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wish you lived nearer than
twelve miles.”</p>

<p>“He has a wonderful constitution. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
has had one stroke of paralysis, he may be
taken suddenly, and he may live for the
next thirty years. Is it long since you met?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen him till lately—since I
was a child.”</p>

<p>“That is strange, though of course India
does break up families.”</p>

<p>“I was adopted by an uncle, and lived in
London most of my time.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I understand; and came out to
visit your father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, partly; indeed, I may say chiefly.”</p>

<p>“And have thrown in your lot with him.
Mr. Jervis, I honour you for it.” Mark
looked uncomfortable, and his companion
added, “This life must be a great change,
indeed, as it were another form of existence,
to you; you must not let yourself stagnate
now you have set your house in order, but
come among us when you can. There
are Bray and Van Zee, the two nearest
planters to you, both good fellows. You
have a much nearer neighbour, that you
will never see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I am sorry to hear that. May
I ask why?”</p>

<p>“It is one who shrinks from encountering
Europeans, even holds aloof from me.
Though we work in the same field, we have
rarely met.”</p>

<p>Mark would have liked to have gleaned
more particulars, but the burly American
missionary was not disposed to be communicative,
and all he could gather about
his mysterious neighbour was, that the
individual was not a European, not a
heathen, and not young.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br><span class="small">A FRIENDLY VISIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Captain Waring had departed for England
without ceremony or beat of drum (leaving
his debts behind him), also presumably his
cousin, who had not had the common
decency to leave P. P. C. cards—no, not
even on the mess or the club—and who had
treated poor Honor Gordon shamefully;
indeed, several matrons agreed that in the
good old days such a man would certainly
have been shot or horsewhipped!</p>

<p>How Colonel Sladen had chuckled,
surmised, and slandered, had bemoaned
the girl’s lost good looks, and her aunt’s
idiotcy to all comers, as he waited impatiently
for his afternoon rubber! Next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
to his whist, the relaxation he most
thoroughly enjoyed was a <i>bonâ fide</i> ill-natured
gossip, with a sauce in the form
of sharp and well-spiced details.</p>

<p>No reliable information respecting Mr.
Jervis had as yet been circulated—for
Clarence, on second thoughts, had kept
his late comrade’s plans and whereabouts
entirely to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande knew, and held her tongue.
What was the good of talking? She was
much subdued in these days, even in the
colour of her raiment. She rarely went
to the club; she dared not face certain
questioning pitiless eyes in the awful
verandah; indeed she kept in the background
to an unparalleled degree. Nevertheless
she had her plans, and was prepared
to rise phoenix-like from the ashes of her
former hopes. She was actually contemplating
a second venture, in the shape of a
niece. She thought Honor wanted cheering
up, and a face from home—especially such
a lovely face—would surely have a happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
result. But Honor’s thoughts were secretly
fixed upon another countenance, a certain
colourless, handsome face—a face she never
expected to see again. Her mind dwelt
with poignant memories on a pair of eyes,
dim with wordless misery, that had looked
into her own that hateful June morning.</p>

<p>“We can well afford it, P.,” urged
his wife, apropos of her scheme. “One
girl is the same as two—one ayah between
them.” She little knew Fairy.</p>

<p>“Please yourself,” cried Mr. Brande, at
last; “but Honor shall always be my niece,
my chief niece, and nothing shall ever
put her nose out of joint with her uncle
Pelham.”</p>

<p>“No one wants to! I should like to see
any one try that, or with me either. But
what a nose Fairy has! Just modelled to
her face like a wax-work.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande talked long and enthusiastically
to Honor about her sister. But Honor
was not responsive; her eyes were averted,
her answers unsatisfactory; indeed, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
said but little, and looked positively uncomfortable
and distressed. And no doubt
she felt a wee bit guilty because she had
prevented the child from coming out before.
But that was very unlike Honor; Mrs.
Brande could not understand it.</p>

<p>How she would exult in a niece who was a
miracle of loveliness, instead of being merely
a pretty, bright, and popular girl. Not that
Honor was very bright now; she was losing
her looks, and Honor’s love affair had come
to such a woeful end. Honor was not the
sort of girl to take up with any one else;
and, indeed, she could not wonder. Poor
Mark! of all her boys, he was the one
nearest to her heart.</p>

<p>Still she considered that he had carried
filial love a great deal too far, when she had
thought over his sacrifice in moments of
cool reflection. It was a shame that Mark,
and Honor, and a magnificent fortune
should all be sacrificed to an eccentric old
hermit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande said little; she was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
receiving the support and encouragement
she expected. She placed Fairy’s photograph
in poor Ben’s silver frame in a
conspicuous place in the drawing-room, and
she mentally sketched out the rough draft
of another letter to Hoyle.</p>

<p>Before this letter took definite shape,
Mrs. Langrishe came to call—a dinner
“call”—in full state and her best afternoon
toilet. Seating herself on the sofa, she
began to tell Mrs. Brande all about her
dear invalid, exactly as if she were talking
to a most sympathetic listener—instead of
to a deadly rival.</p>

<p>“He is such a nice man, and so quiet in
a house.”</p>

<p>“For that matter,” retorted Mrs. Brande,
“he is quiet enough out of the house, and
everywhere else.”</p>

<p>“And he is so contented and easily
amused,” continued Mrs. Langrishe. “I
left him with Lalla reading aloud to him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that is <i>quite</i> the thing?”
inquired Mrs. Brande, with a dubious sniff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Why should she not do it as well as
hospital nurses?” demanded her visitor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande reflected on the result of
her own nursing. Would this nursing have
the same effect?</p>

<p>“Hospital nurses are generally young,
single, and very frequently pretty,” resumed
Mrs. Langrishe. “They read to their
patients, and take tea with them, and no
one says a word. All the difference
between them and these girls is, their
uniform and their experience; and surely
<i>no</i> one ever dreams of making a remark
about those excellent, devoted young
women!”</p>

<p>Lalla was not excellent, but she had
certainly been most devoted—as her aunt
thankfully acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I should allow
Honor to do it,” said Mrs. Brande, with a
meditative air.</p>

<p>“Possibly not. It would, of course,
depend upon circumstances. Now”—laying
two fingers playfully on Mrs. Brande’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
round arm—“I am going to be a little bird,
and whisper a little secret in your ear.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande drew back, as if she thought
Mrs. Langrishe was going to be a little
rattlesnake.</p>

<p>“It is not to be given out for a few days,
but Lalla and Sir Gloster are engaged. It
is quite settled.”</p>

<p>Sir Gloster had only proposed the
previous evening, and had begged that
the fact of the engagement might be kept
quiet for a week, until he had wired home
to his all-important mother. She must be
told before any one. Yes, he had succumbed
to Lalla’s bright blandishments.
He was a dull, heavy man; he liked to be
amused. He would have amusement all
day long when Lalla was his wife. She
had a charming voice, and read aloud well.
She brought him all the scraps of news,
she was an admirable mimic, an adroit
flatterer, and altogether a charming girl;
and her daily <i>tête-à-têtes</i> were of a most
stimulating character, and he looked forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
to them with keen anticipation. She gave
him a capital description of the unmasking
of Captain Waring, the sensation created
by the <i>soi-disant</i> poor relation; how every
one was certain that it was going to be a
match between him and Miss Gordon;
how he had absconded, and Miss Gordon
was left. He had evidently joined his
friend in Bombay—<i>wise</i> young man!</p>

<p>Sir Gloster, who was naturally of a huffy
and implacable disposition, had never
recovered the shock to his affections and
self-esteem. He was by no means sorry
to hear that in her turn Miss Gordon had
been spurned, and he was resolved to show
her how speedily <i>he</i> had been consoled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe, when she entered Mrs.
Brande’s house, had not intended to divulge
her great news—merely to throw out hints,
draw comparisons, and trample more or
less on the fallen and forsaken.</p>

<p>But for once human nature was too
strong for her: she would have had a
serious illness if she had not then and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
there relieved her mind of her overwhelming
achievement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande opened her blue eyes to
their widest extent; her worst fears were
confirmed.</p>

<p>She however mustered up an artificial
smile, and said—</p>

<p>“I am sure you are very pleased,” which
was true—“and I am glad indeed to hear
it,” which was not true.</p>

<p>“It is to be kept quiet for a week,”
murmured Mrs. Langrishe; “but I am
telling you as an old friend, who I feel
<i>sure</i> will be pleased with the news. Of
course, we are all delighted; it is everything
we could wish,” and she drew herself up.</p>

<p>“I should rather think it was!” rejoined
Mrs. Brande, tartly; she was but human
after all.</p>

<p>“My brother and all my people will be
much gratified—Sir Gloster is such a dear
good fellow, and so well off, and <i>so</i> steady.”</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t be a little <i>too</i> steady
for Lalla!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Not he; and he delights in all her fun,
and singing——”</p>

<p>“And dancing?” suggested Mrs. Brande,
significantly.</p>

<p>“It will not be a long engagement,”
ignoring this little thrust. “This is the
second week of September; we shall all be
going down in another six weeks. We
will have the wedding in about a month.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Mrs. Brande’s tongue
to say, “Delays are dangerous,” but she
closed her lips.</p>

<p>“Where is Honor?” inquired Mrs.
Langrishe, with rare effusion.</p>

<p>“She has gone off down the khud to get
ivy for the table. I have a small dinner
this evening.”</p>

<p>“You are always having dinners, you
wonderful woman.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, in Pelham’s <i>position</i>,
we must entertain, and I make it a rule
to have a dinner once a week.”</p>

<p>“You are quite a providence to the
station!” cried her visitor affectedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
“How pretty those grasses are. I suppose
Honor arranged them? What a useful girl
she is!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she takes all trouble off my hands.
I don’t know how I shall ever get on without
her.”</p>

<p>“How lucky for you, that there is no
chance of her <i>leaving</i> you! My dear, that
was a most unfortunate affair about Mr.
Jervis.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” inquired Mrs.
Brande, whose crest began to rise.</p>

<p>“Oh,” with a disagreeable laugh, “it
is what did <i>he mean</i>! He paid Honor the
most devoted attention, and the moment
he was revealed in his true colours—he
fled. No one knows what has become of
him.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me—<i>we</i> do!” returned his
champion, with a quiver of her double chin.</p>

<p>“And—where is he, dear? what is he
doing?”</p>

<p>“He is doing a good—a noble action.
Putting himself and his wishes aside for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
the sake of others,” returned Mrs. Brande
in a white heat of emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh well,” rather disconcerted, “if you
and Honor, and above all <i>Mr. Brande</i>, are
satisfied, of course there is no more to be
said——”</p>

<p>“No,” pointedly. “I hope no more will
<i>be</i> said. Have you seen the photograph
of my other niece, Honor’s sister?” making
a desperate effort to rally and change the
conversation, and reaching for the frame,
which she solemnly placed in Mrs. Langrishe’s
hand.</p>

<p>“What do you think of her?” Here
at least she was certain of scoring a small
triumph.</p>

<p>“Think, my dear woman! Why, that
she is perfectly lovely.” (It was safe to
praise a girl who was in England.)</p>

<p>“At first she was coming out to me,”
her aunt pursued, “but she changed her
mind. Now we are thinking of having
her out in November with the Hadfield’s
girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Mrs. Langrishe, reflectively,
and still nursing the picture, as
it were, on her knee.</p>

<p>She had a wonderful knack of picking
up odd bits of news, and her brain contained
useful little scraps of the most promiscuous
description. Her mind was a sort of ragbag,
and these scraps often came in appropriately.
She rummaged out a scrap now.</p>

<p>She had recently heard, from a cousin
of hers (an artist), of a Mrs. Gordon, a
widow with two daughters, one of them
lovely, who was sitting to him as Rowena—an
ideal Rowena—but who was also a
dwarf—a sort of little creature that you
might exhibit.</p>

<p>“Does your niece live at Hoyle, and is
her name Fairy?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why do you ask?” rather
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I have heard of her, recently, from my
cousin, Oscar Crabbe. And why did she
not come out?” looking at her with a
queer smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Her health was not very good—and
there was some other reason—which I have
not been told.”</p>

<p>“I know the reason, and can tell you, if
you like,” said Mrs. Langrishe, with an air
of affectionate confidence.</p>

<p>Here was an unexpected opportunity of
planting a dart in her adversary’s side.</p>

<p>“There is no object in keeping the
matter secret, it is just as foolish as that
scheme of young Jervis’s, who was like an
ostrich sticking his head in the sand. By
the way, it appears that <i>that</i> is quite an
exploded idea! Every one in Hoyle knows
Miss Fairy Gordon’s appearance—she is
extraordinary lovely—but——”</p>

<p>“But not mad? Don’t say she is mad!”
protested Mrs. Brande, excitedly.</p>

<p>“No, no; not so bad as that. But,”
looking steadily into her listener’s eyes,
she added, “poor little creature, she is a
<i>dwarf</i>! She never grew after she was ten,
I am told. Yes, it is a dreadful pity,” gazing
into her hostess’s horrified countenance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
“Sitting down, she is just like other people—but
when she stands up, she seems to
have no legs.”</p>

<p>“A dwarf! No legs! And she thought
of coming to me! And I was just going to
write and ask her to start in November,”
repeated Mrs. Brande in gasps.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, it is a most fortunate
circumstance that your letter has not gone.
What could you have done with her? You
could never have taken her out except <i>after
dark</i>.”</p>

<p>This was a terribly effective thrust. Mrs.
Brande was wholly unable to retaliate, and
made no reply.</p>

<p>“A dwarf!” Her mind conjured up a
little fat sallow woman, such as she had
once seen outside a show at a fair, and that
miserable stunted native who was carried
about Shirani, begging, on the shoulders of
a boy.</p>

<p>And her niece, of whose picture she was
so proud, that she had placed it in a solid
silver frame—her lovely niece was like that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder Honor never told me,”
murmured Mrs. Brande at last.</p>

<p>“And I do not,” was the emphatic
rejoinder. “From all accounts, the mother
and sisters have always spoiled the little
one, who believes that she is in no way
different to other people, and is too ridiculously
vain. Even if she had been five foot
six, I am sure that you are far happier
without her,” concluded Mrs. Langrishe,
rising and squeezing her hostess’s hand as
she spoke. And having offered this small
fragment of consolation, she rustled away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande, poor woman, had been
indeed trampled upon, and crushed to the
very earth. She had been asked to join in
her rival’s song of triumph over Miss Paske’s
superb success; she had been condoled with
on her own dear girl’s misfortunes; and
she had been informed that she was aunt to
a dwarf!</p>

<p>She sat for some time in a shattered,
stupefied condition; then she got up, and
hastily carried off Fairy’s photograph and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
locked it away in a box, secure from all
eyes, and from even the ayah’s inquisitive
brown fingers.</p>

<p>Honor noticed the absence of her sister’s
picture from its usual post of honour—it
was nowhere to be seen—the absence of
Fairy’s name in conversation, the sudden
cessation of all interest in Gerty Hadfield’s
movements, and guessed rightly that some
one had kindly enlightened her aunt, and
that she was in possession of the <i>other</i>
reason now.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.<br><span class="small">THE NEW WEARER OF THE CORNELIAN RING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Six weeks had crawled by. With all his
occupation Mark found time desperately
hard to kill; he felt as if he had lived his
present life for at least six years. The
monsoon had broken, and on some days the
torrents compelled him to remain indoors;
and whilst sheets of rain and hurricanes of
wind swept the valley, an appalling loneliness
settled down upon the miserable young
man. His father passed many hours in
sleep, and he had not a soul with whom to
exchange a word. One evening, during a
welcome break, he was riding homewards
down a steep and slippery path that wound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
through wet dark pine-woods, when his
pony suddenly shied so violently as almost
to lose its footing; he had taken fright at
an undefined object beside the road,
something which at first his rider mistook
for a bear, until it emitted a groan of unmistakable
human anguish.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Jervis, as
he quickly dismounted.</p>

<p>“Alas, I have hurt my foot!” replied a
female voice in Hindostani. “I fell down—I
cannot walk.”</p>

<p>Jervis threw the bridle over his arm, lit
a match, and, shading it with his hand,
saw, huddled up, what appeared to be an
old native woman. She explained to him,
between groans and gasps, that she had
twisted her ankle over a root on the path,
and could not move.</p>

<p>“Are you far from home?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Three miles.”</p>

<p>“In which direction?”</p>

<p>“The hill above the old cantonment.”</p>

<p>“I know. If you think you can sit on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
my pony, I will lead him and take you
home safely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am such a coward,” she cried.
“Is the pony gentle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is all right; I will answer for
the pony.”</p>

<p>“I—and I cannot bear pain. Oh—oh!
but I must”—vainly struggling to rise,
and sinking down again.</p>

<p>She proved a light weight, as Jervis
raised her bodily in his arms, and placed
her in the saddle. Fortunately the pony,
who bore the suggestive name of “Shaitan,”
was too much sobered by a long journey to
offer any active opposition to carrying a
lady. The homeward progress proved
exceedingly tedious; the road was bad and
nearly pitch dark. The native woman,
who appeared to know every yard of the
way, directed her companion by a path
almost swallowed up in jungle, to a hill
behind the old mess-house. Up and up
they climbed, till they came to a tiny stone
bungalow, with a light in the window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
The door was thrown open by another
native woman and an old man, whose shrill
voluble lamentations were almost deafening.</p>

<p>“You had better let me carry you in?”
suggested Jervis.</p>

<p>“No, no.” Then imperiously to the
other woman, “Anima, bring hither a
chair and help me down.”</p>

<p>But Anima, of the lean and shrivelled
frame, had been set a task far beyond her
strength, and in the end it was the
muscular arms of the young Englishman
that lifted the other from the saddle. As
he placed her carefully on the ground, her
shawl, or saree, fell back, and the lamplight
revealed a fair-skinned woman with
snow-white hair, and a pair of magnificent
black eyes. She was possibly fifty years
of age—or more—and though her lips were
drawn with pain, she was remarkably
handsome, with a high-bred cast of countenance.
No native this; at any rate,
she resembled no native that Jervis had
ever seen. Who was she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>A glance into the interior surprised him
still further; instead of the usual jumble
of cooking-pots, mats, and hookahs, he
caught a glimpse of a round table, with
a crimson cover. A newspaper, or what
looked like one, lay upon it; there was
an armchair, a fire blazing in a fireplace,
with a cat sedately blinking before it.</p>

<p>Who was this woman? He was not
likely to learn any further particulars—at
present, for she was helped in by her two
servants; and as he waited, the door was
abruptly closed and barred, and he was
left outside, alone in the cold and darkness.
Here was gratitude!</p>

<p>He rode slowly home, the pony figuratively
groping his way, whilst his master
was lost in speculation. This was the
mysterious neighbour, he felt certain; this
was the tender of the graves—the owner
of the voice.</p>

<p>He related his adventure to his father
whilst they played picquet.</p>

<p>Major Jervis was not half as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
surprised as the young man had anticipated—he
simply stroked his forehead, a
favourite trick of his, and said, with his
eyes still fastened on his cards—</p>

<p>“Oh, so you have come across the Persian
woman! I so seldom hear of her, I had
forgotten her.”</p>

<p>“Persian?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She has been in these hills for
years, working among the lepers. A fair-skinned
woman, with great haunting dark
eyes.”</p>

<p>“But who is she?” throwing down his
cards and looking eagerly at his father.</p>

<p>“She is what I tell you,” impatiently—“a
Persian; they are generally fair, and
I dare say she has been handsome in her
day, about thirty years ago. Why are
you so interested?”</p>

<p>“Because I have another idea in my
head; I believe she is an Englishwoman.”</p>

<p>The major’s laugh was loud, and sound,
and not at all mad.</p>

<p>“She is a Persian—only, of course, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
are no judge—and to the very tips of her
fingers.”</p>

<p>“But what is she doing up here?”</p>

<p>“I would rather you asked her that
than I did,” was the extremely sane reply.
“She is a Christian, I believe, and is
working out her sins. I have no doubt
she is a woman with a past. You can
read it in her eyes. Come, my boy, take
up your hand; it’s your turn to play.”</p>

<p>Mark Jervis, as we know, had not been
permitted time or opportunity to read anything,
whether referring to past or present,
in the Persian’s eyes; but this omission
was corrected ere long.</p>

<p>One afternoon he noticed a figure, stick
in hand, resting on the mess-house steps,
as he rode by—a figure which raised the stick,
and imperatively summoned him to approach.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly his recent acquaintance,
who pulled the veil further over her
head, as she said—</p>

<p>“Sahib, I wish to thank you for your
charitable benevolence. Truly, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
you, I should have lain all night in the
forest, in the rain, and among the beasts.”</p>

<p>“I hope you are better?” he asked,
doffing his cap.</p>

<p>“Yea, nearly well. Though I am a
stranger to you, I know that you are Jones
Sahib’s son.”</p>

<p>“Major ‘Jervis’ is his real name. Yes—I
am his son.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you,” she continued,
rather loftily.</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“From the leper-folk,” she added,
significantly.</p>

<p>“It is you who keep the graves yonder
in order?”</p>

<p>“May be!” was her cautious reply.</p>

<p>“And who sing English hymns in the
old church?”</p>

<p>A slight contraction passed over her face
as she replied—</p>

<p>“Nay—I am a Persian woman from
Bushire. What should I know of thy songs
or thy tongue?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Then who—can it be?” inquired
Jervis, looking at her steadfastly.</p>

<p>“Noble youth—why ask me? A woman
from the dead, perchance,” she retorted
mockingly.</p>

<p>“At least, it is you who do so much
good among the sick Pahari-folk and
lepers?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Yea, I am but one—the field is great.
Who can fill jars with dew? I would I
could do more.”</p>

<p>“I believe that were hardly possible.”</p>

<p>“As far as these hands go,” extending
a pair of delicately-shaped members, “I
do what I can; but what is one lemon
for a whole village to squeeze! If I had
a big house that would serve as a hospital,
I should have my heart’s desire. I am
skilled in medicine, so also is my servant;
we would have our sick beside us, and
could do much—that is my dream. It will
never come to pass till the sun shall be
folded up and the stars shall fall.”</p>

<p>“Surely one of these bungalows would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
answer. Why not this mess-house?” suggested
Jervis generously.</p>

<p>“True; but the sircar would not yield
it to me. Already the sircar has given me
my abode; and, doubtless, were I to ask for
the Mess Khana, they would aver that I
was like to the man who, on receiving a
cucumber, demanded a tope of mango
trees! Moreover this dead station may reawaken
once more. Even in <i>my</i> memory
the merry sahibs and mem sahibs have
sojourned here, and held great tamashas;
but it is years since they came, and the
place, perchance, is forgotten.”</p>

<p>“And so you have lived here alone—for
years?” said the young man. His remarkably
expressive eyes distinctly added the
“<i>Why?</i>” his tongue refrained from
uttering.</p>

<p>“Yea, I have been dead to the world
and the roar of strife and life for many
moons! If all tales be true—tales whispered
even in this empty land—you have forsaken
many delights to give your days to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
old man, your father? Is it not so?”
She looked up with a quick gesture, and
her saree fell back.</p>

<p>As Jervis gazed down into the dark eyes
turned towards him, he agreed with his
father; here was undoubtedly a woman with
a past—and a tragic past!</p>

<p>“It is a noble sacrifice,” she continued;
“but what saith the Koran? ‘Whatever
good works ye send on for your behoof,
ye shall find them with God.’ I am old
enough to be your mother. I marvel if I
had had a son, would he sacrifice himself
thus for me—were I of your people, a
Feringhee woman, I marvel?” she repeated
meditatively, as she put up her hand to
draw her veil further over her head.</p>

<p>As she did so, the young man started
as he recognized her ring—Honor’s cornelian
ring. Many a time he had noticed it on
her finger, and her peculiar trick of turning
it round and round, when in any mental
quandary, had been the subject of more
than one family jest. How came it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
be on the hand of this Mahommedan
woman?</p>

<p>She instantly interpreted his glance, and
exclaimed—</p>

<p>“You observe my ring. Truly it is
of little value—in money—but to me it
is beyond price. It was given to me
by a maiden I saw but once. Her words
were pearls, her lips were rubies, but her
music, and her eyes, drew the story of my
life from my inmost soul.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I know the lady!” cried her
listener impetuously, “young—and tall—and
beautiful. She plays what you call
the sitar. Where did you meet her?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sahib, that is <i>my</i> secret,” she
answered after an expressive pause; “but,
lo! I can reveal yours,” and she looked
at him steadily as she added, “<i>you love
her</i>.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he stammered.
“Why do you say so?” and he coloured
up to the roots of his crisp brown hair.</p>

<p>“Of a truth, I read it in your face. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
is not for naught that folk call me a
magic wallah.” And she rose stiffly to
depart. “You have abandoned her, I see,”
she continued, with a flash of her wonderful
eyes, “and lo, the fat old mem sahib, her
mother, will marry her to some one else!
Behold your reward, for doing your duty!”
And entirely forgetting her previous quotation
from the Koran, with this unpleasant
and cynical remark, the Persian made him
a profound salaam, and hobbled away.</p>

<p>The rains were over by the middle of
August, and Shirani cast off mackintoshes,
discarded umbrellas, and society—restless
and fluctuating—looked about for some fresh
and novel form of out-door amusement.</p>

<p>Among the second-leave arrivals, the
most active and enterprising of the new-comers,
was a Captain Bevis, the moving
power in whatever station he was quartered;
the very man for getting up dances, races,
and picnics. He was resolved to strike
out an entirely original line on the present
occasion, and inaugurated a grand joint
expedition into the interior—none of your
exclusive “family parties,” or a petty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
little “set” of half a dozen couples. No,
this sanguine individual actually proposed
to move Shirani <i>en masse</i>. He had heard
of the abandoned cantonment, of Hawal
Bagh, galloped over to inspect it with his
customary promptitude, and came flying
back to the station on the wings of
enthusiasm. “It was a perfect spot,” this
was his verdict; scenery exquisite, good road,
good water, lots of bungalows, a mess-house
to dance in, a parade ground for gymkanas.
Every one must see the place, every one
must enjoy a short informal outing, the
entertainment to be called the “Hawal
Bagh week.” Captain Bevis threw himself
into the project heart and soul; he
invited another hill station to join; he
sent out circulars, he collected entries for
gymkanas and polo matches, and the names
of patronesses for the grand ball at Hawal
Bagh. Dead and long-forgotten Hawal
Bagh, that was to awake and live once
more!</p>

<p>Subscriptions poured in, parties went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
over to explore, empty houses were allotted,
a vast army of coolies was enlisted, the
jungle was cut down, the bungalows
cleaned up, the very gardens were put in
order. A quantity of supplies and cart
loads of furniture were soon <i>en route</i>, and
the servants of Shirani entered into the
project with the zeal of the true Indian-born
domestic, who hails a change, a
“tamasha,” anything in the shape of a
“feast,” with a joy and energy totally
unknown to the retainers of the folk in
these colder latitudes.</p>

<p>Hospitable Mrs. Brande was to have
a house and a house-party. “P.” was
absent on official business; but, under any
circumstances, he would not have been a
likely recruit for what he called a “new
outbreak of jungle fever.” The Dashwoods,
the Booles, the Daubenys, the Clovers,
were to have a married people’s mess.
There were also one or two chummeries,
which made people look at one another
and smile! The bachelors, of course, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
their own mess; moreover, there were
tents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe joined neither mess nor
chummery, this clever woman was merely
coming as the Clovers’ guest for two days,
and Lalla was Mrs. Dashwood’s sole charge.
Mrs. Sladen, of course, stayed with Mrs.
Brande, who had been relegated to the
old commandant’s house, an important-looking
roomy bungalow, standing in a
great wilderness of a garden and peach
orchard. Once or twice during the last
twenty years it, and one or two other
bungalows, had been let (to the Persian’s
great annoyance) for a few months in the
season to needy families from the plains,
who only wanted air, good hill air, and
could afford but little else!</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande and her party arrived a
whole day before the general public,
travelling comfortably by easy stages
through great forests of pine, oak, or
rhododendron, along the face of bold, bare
cliffs, across shallow river-beds, and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
more than one exquisite park-like glade,
dotted with trees and cattle—naturally,
Mrs. Brande kept a suspicious eye on these
latter. When the travellers reached their
destination, they found that roads had
been repaired, lamp-posts and oil lamps
erected, the old band-stand was renovated—servants
were hurrying to and fro, carrying
furniture, shaking carpets, airing bedding
and picketing ponies. There were coolies,
syces, soldiers, and active sahibs galloping
about giving directions. In fact, Hawal
Bagh had put back the clock of time,
and to a cursory eye was once more the
bustling, populous cantonment of forty
years ago!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And how did the scanty society who
dwelt in those parts relish the resurrection
of Hawal Bagh? To the neighbouring
poor hill villagers this event was truly
a god-send; they reaped a splendid and
totally unexpected harvest, and were
delighted to welcome the invaders, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
purchased their fowl, eggs, grain, milk,
and honey.</p>

<p>Mark Jervis beheld the transformation
with mingled feelings. He had broken
with his old life; most people, if they
thought of him at all, believed him to be
in England—two months is a long time
to live in the memory of a hill station.
Honor—she would be at Hawal Bagh—she
had not forgotten him yet. He would
hang about the hills, that he might catch
a distant glimpse of her, or even of her
dress. Surely he might afford himself that
small consolation.</p>

<p>As for the Persian, she surveyed the
troops of gay strangers from her eerie with
a mixture of transports and anguish.</p>

<p>It was a fine moonlight night early in
September, the hills loomed dark, and cast
deep shadows into the bright white valley.
The air was languorously soft, the milky
way shone conspicuous, and fully justified
its Eastern name, “The Gate of Heaven.”</p>

<p>There was to be a ball in the old mess-house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
and Mark took his stand on the hill
and watched the big cooking fires, the
lit-up bungalows, the hurrying figures;
listened to the hum of voices, the neighing
of ponies, the tuning of musical instruments.
Could this be really the condemned, deserted
cantonment of Hawal Bagh, that many
a night he had seen wrapped in deathlike
silence? The dance commenced briskly,
open doorways showed gay decorations,
the band played a lively set of lancers,
and a hundred merry figures seemed to
flit round and pass and repass; whilst the
jackals and hyenas, who had been wont to
hold their assemblies in the same quarter,
slunk away up the hills in horrified disgust.
Presently people came out into the bright
moonlight, and began to stroll up and
down. Mark recognized many well-known
figures. There was Honor, in white, walking
with a little man who was conversing
and gesticulating with considerable vivacity.
She seemed preoccupied, and held her
head high—gazing straight before her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Lookers on see most of the game. The man
must be a dense idiot not to notice that she
was not listening to one word he said.</p>

<p>There was Miss Paske, escorted by a
ponderous companion with a rolling gait—Sir
Gloster, of course—and Miss Lalla was
undoubtedly entertaining him. It almost
seemed as if he could hear his emphatic
“excellent” where he stood. Mrs. Merryfeather
and Captain Dorrington, Captain
Merryfeather and Miss Fleet, and so on—and
so on—as pair after pair came forth.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of the fact
that he was not the only spectator. Just
below him stood a figure, so motionless,
that he had taken it for part of a tree.
The figure moved, and he saw the Persian
lady standing gazing with fixed ravenous
eyes on the scene below them. He made a
slight movement, and she turned hastily
and came up towards him. They were
acquaintances of some standing now, and
met once or twice a week either among
the lepers or about the cantonment. Mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
had never ventured to call at the
mysterious little bungalow, but he sent
her offerings of flowers, fruit, and hill
partridges, and she in return admitted him
to her friendship—to an entirely unprecedented
extent. Whether this was due
to the young man’s handsome face, and
chivalrous respect for her privacy and her
sex, or whether it was accorded for the
sake of another, who shall say?</p>

<p>“You are looking on, like myself,” he
remarked, as she accosted him. “Are you
interested?”</p>

<p>“Nay, ‘the world is drowned to him who
is drowned,’ says the proverb. I came to
Hawal Bagh to retire from the crowd, and
lo! a crowd is at my gates!”</p>

<p>“This, surely, must be quite a novel
sight to you?”</p>

<p>She gazed at him questioningly, and
made no answer.</p>

<p>“Of course you have never seen this sort
of thing before, English people in evening
dress, dancing to a band?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“I have known phantoms—yea, I have
seen such as these,” pointing, “in a—dream—thousands
of years ago.”</p>

<p>Her companion made no reply, the
Persian often uttered dark sayings that
were totally beyond his comprehension.
Possibly she believed in the transmigration
of souls, and was alluding to a former
existence.</p>

<p>“Mine are but spirits, whereas to you
these people are real flesh and blood,”
she resumed. “You were one of them
but three months ago. Think well ere
you break with your past, and kill and bury
youth. Lo, you grow old <i>already</i>! Let me
plead for youth, and love. Heaven has
opened to me to-day. She,” lowering her
voice to a whisper, “is among those—I
have seen her—she is there below.”</p>

<p>“I know,” he answered, also in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Then why do you not seek her—so
young, so fair, so good? Oh! have you
forgotten her sweet smile, her charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
eyes? Love, real love, comes but once!
Go now and find her.”</p>

<p>Mark shook his head with emphatic
negation.</p>

<p>“What heart of stone!” she cried
passionately. “Truly I will go myself and
fetch her here. I——But no—I dare
not,” and she covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>“Do not add your voice to my own
mad inclinations. It is all over between
us. To meet her and to part again would
give her needless pain.”</p>

<p>“Ah! again the music,” murmured the
Persian, as the band suddenly struck up a
weird haunting waltz, which her companion
well remembered—they had played it at the
bachelors’ ball. “Music,” she continued,
clenching her two hands, “of any kind
has a sore effect on me. It tears my
heart from my very body, and yet I love
it, yea, though it transport me to——” She
paused, unable to finish the sentence. Her
lips trembled, her great dark eyes dilated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
and she suddenly burst into a storm of
tears. The sound of her wild, loud,
despairing sobs, actually floated down and
penetrated to the ears of a merry couple
who were strolling at large, and now stood
immediately below, little guessing that
another pair on the hillside were sadly contemplating
a scene of once familiar but now
lost delights, like two poor wandering spirits.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Mrs. Merryfeather, “I
heard a human voice, right up there above
us. It sounded just like a woman weeping—crying
as if her heart was broken.”</p>

<p>“Oh, impossible!” scoffed the man.
“Hearts in these days are warranted
unbreakable, like toughened glass.”</p>

<p>“Listen! There it is again!” interrupted
the lady excitedly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, my dear Mrs. Merry;
and your sex would not feel flattered if they
heard that you had mistaken the cry of
a <i>wild beast</i>, for a woman’s voice! I assure
you, on my word of honour, that it is
nothing but a hyena.”</p>

</div>


<p>A powerful and determined temptation,
that was deaf to reason or argument,
struggled hourly to drag Mark Jervis to
Hawal Bagh. It changed its fierce wrestlings,
and passionate and even frantic
pleadings to soft alluring whispers. It
whispered that life was but an hour in
the æons of time—a drop in the ocean
of eternity. Why not taste the drop—enjoy
the hour? Snatch the sunshine and
live one’s little day, ere passing for ever
into eternal darkness and oblivion! It
even quoted the Scriptures, and vehemently
urged him to take no thought for the
morrow—that sufficient unto the day was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the evil thereof. It seized the brush from
the hand of memory, and painted Honor
Gordon as an angel. It babbled of a visit
to Mrs. Brande—<i>she</i> had always been his
friend. Surely there was no harm in going
to see <i>her</i>! But the young man sternly
silenced alike whisperings or pleadings.
He beat the mad tempter to its knees,
choked it, and, as he believed, put it to
death. Why undergo the anguish of
parting twice—why walk across red-hot
plough-shares a second time?</p>

<p>For four whole days he held aloof, and
never visited the cantonment—save in his
thoughts and dreams. On the fifth he
conscientiously set forth in the opposite
direction, and after a long and aimless
ride was astonished to find himself—no,
not exactly on the enchanted ground, but
close to the old rifle-range, which lay at
the back of its encompassing hills. To
the left dipped a long valley, on the right
of the path towered a forest of rhododendrons
and ever-green oaks, carpeted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
ferns, and a blaze of delicate autumn
flowers; here and there the Virginia creeper
flared, and here and there a pale passion-flower
had flung abroad its eager tendrils
and attached two noble trees. All at once,
a fat white puppy came bustling through
the undergrowth; he was chasing a family
of respectable elderly monkeys, with the
audacity common to his age and race.
Truly the pup is the father of the dog;
and Jervis, who was walking slowly with
his pony following him, recognized this
particular pup at once as an old friend.
He had bought him and presented him
to Mrs. Brande, when her grief was as
yet too fresh—and this same rollicking,
well-to-do animal had once been indignantly
spurned! To whom did he now belong?
Who was his master or his mistress?
There was a sound of light young footsteps,
a crashing of small twigs, a glimpse of
a white dress, and an anxious girlish voice
calling, “Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!”</p>

<p>In another second Honor Gordon ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
down into the path, about thirty yards
ahead of Tommy’s donor. She was almost
breathless, her hat was in her hand—possibly
it had been snatched off by an
inquisitive branch as she struggled after
the runaway. The soft little locks on her
forehead were ruffled, and she had an
unusually brilliant colour.</p>

<p>As Mark’s starving eyes devoured her
face he thought he had never seen her look
so lovely. He summoned up all his self-command—there
must be no going back
to “old days,” no moaning over “what
might have been.” No; he was the
stronger, and must set a stern example.</p>

<p>For quite twenty seconds there was a
dead silence, a silence only broken by the
trickling of a snow-born mountain stream,
passing lingeringly through the ferns and
orchids—who seemed to stoop and bend
over—listening intently to its timid silvery
song.</p>

<p>“How changed he was!” thought Honor,
with a queer tight feeling in her throat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
“only three short months, and the bright
look of buoyant youth had faded from his
face.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, with a supreme
effort. “I had a presentiment that I
should see you soon—I dreamt it!”</p>

<p>“Dreams sometimes go by contraries,”
he answered, with a rather fixed smile.</p>

<p>“And how clever of Tommy to find
you! The dear dog remembered you.”</p>

<p>“Well, up to the present he has not
shown any symptoms of recognizing me;
on the contrary, he has cut me dead.
He is in hot pursuit of some venerable
lumgoors. How long is it since he has
seen me?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“The day of the bachelors’ ball. I
recollect you gave him a <i>méringue</i>, and
very nearly killed him! It was on the
eighth of June. This is the tenth of
September; just three months and two
days.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” he acquiesced, with forced
<i>nonchalance</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Do you live near here?” she continued.</p>

<p>“About four miles, by a goat path across
that hill.”</p>

<p>“Pray are you aware that we are picnicing
below, with half Shirani?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; but not another starvation
picnic I hope?”</p>

<p>“And yet,” ignoring his ill-timed jest,
“you have never come to see us, and we
leave to-morrow!”</p>

<p>He looked down to avoid her questioning
eyes, and made no answer, beyond a faint,
half-strangled sigh.</p>

<p>“At least we are still friends,” she urged,
swallowing something in her throat.</p>

<p>“Yes—always; but I thought I had better
remain away. The Shirani folk would take
me for a ghost, and I might upset their
nerves. What is the latest station news?”</p>

<p>“Our latest news is, that Mrs. Sladen
is to go home at Christmas. Miss Clover
is engaged to Captain Burne, and Miss
Paske to Sir Gloster Sandilands,” she
answered stiffly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Poor Toby! I suppose my former
acquaintances believe me to be in England—if
they ever think of me at all?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, twisted her ring round
and round, and then said—</p>

<p>“Your friends,” with emphasis, “know
that you are out in this country, looking
after your father. How is he?”</p>

<p>“Wonderfully better, thank you.”</p>

<p>“And you—you have been ill?” she
remarked rather tremulously.</p>

<p>“No, indeed; I never was better in my
life. Of course you saw Waring before he
went down?”</p>

<p>“No,” with undeniable embarrassment.
“In fact, he copied your example, and
dispensed with all farewells. He—he—left
rather suddenly,” and she coloured.</p>

<p>“Why do you hesitate?” looking at her
keenly. “What did he <i>do</i>? He has been
doing something, I can see.”</p>

<p>“It was rather what he did <i>not</i> do,” with
a constrained laugh. “Of course it is no
business of mine. He did not pay any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
of his bills. I am not sure whether I ought
to tell you.”</p>

<p>“And I am quite sure you ought,” he
answered with decision.</p>

<p>“But he left such quantities of debts
behind him, and no—address——”</p>

<p>“Debts?” he repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, he paid for nothing. Club
accounts, card accounts, mess bills, servants’
wages—not even his bearer’s bill for thread
and buttons and blacking. People,” with
a nervous little laugh, “seem to think
that was the greatest enormity of all!”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Mark, his pale face turning
to a vivid red, “I will tell you of a
greater. I knew he had spent and muddled
away most of our joint-funds, and the day
I was last in Shirani I collected the bills
and gave him all the money I had in the
world—a cheque for five hundred pounds—to
settle our affairs. He swore, on his
honour, he would pay them at once and
send me the receipts. Now, of course,
every one in Shirani believes me to be as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
great a swindler and thief as he is! They
must naturally suppose that I—I—bolted
from my creditors! I,” with increasing
warmth, “now understand why you stammered
and hesitated when I asked if I
was not forgotten. Forgotten! I shall
live in people’s memories for years—on the
principle that ‘the evil which men do lives
after them.’”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I told you——” she began
eagerly.</p>

<p>“And I have chiefly myself to blame. I
was an idiot to trust Waring. I had had
one lesson; but—I was half mad with my
own troubles, and determined to tear myself
away from Shirani at once. I felt that if
I stayed on I might yield to temptation—good
resolutions and fresh impressions might
fade—and I might never return here——”</p>

<p>The pup, flouted and evaded by the
scornful lumgoors, and exhausted by his
tremendous efforts, now squatted on the
path, apparently listening open-mouthed
to every word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>The grey pony had also drawn near, and
occasionally rubbed his handsome head
against his master’s shoulder, as much as
to say—“Enough of such fooling; let us
move on!”</p>

<p>“This is horrible!” continued Mark.
“I hate to owe a penny, and I have no
means of paying our joint-debts, for Waring
has wolfed the cheque.”</p>

<p>“And your uncle?”</p>

<p>“He has never written once. From his
point of view I have treated him atrociously,
and I am awfully sorry he should think
so, for I am very fond of him. Of course
he has done with me.” And, with a grim
smile, “I am now in sober truth—a <i>real</i>
poor relation. I am a pretty sort of fellow,”
he went on, “I have talked of nothing
but myself—and money—money—money,
for the last five minutes. Tell me of
<i>yourself</i>. Are you having a good time?”</p>

<p>“<i>A good time!</i>” she echoed, with a flash
of her dark grey eyes.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Honor,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
humbly. “But it has been one of my
few consolations when I roam about these
hills, to think that you were happier than
I am.”</p>

<p>“And had forgotten <i>you</i>?” she added
expressively.</p>

<p>“And,” with a slight tremor in his
voice—“had forgotten <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Never!” she returned, with passionate
energy.</p>

<p>“Yes—you will, in time; perhaps not
for two or three years—for you are not
like other girls. I am your first lover—nothing
can deprive me of that memory.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing,” she admitted, almost in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“But, you know, they say a woman
generally marries her <i>second</i> love,” with
a laborious effort to speak steadily.</p>

<p>“How calmly you can discuss my lovers,
and my future!” cried Honor, indignantly.
“Oh, how hard you have become—how
cold—how cruel!”</p>

<p>“Cruel—if I am cruel—only to be kind,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
he replied steadily. “For, years to come,
you will thank me—and think——”</p>

<p>“I think,” she interrupted, with a pitiful
little gesture, “that when we meet so—seldom—scarcely
ever—that you might
be——” here her voice totally failed
her.</p>

<p>She had grown much paler, and her
breath came quickly, as she tried to keep
down a sob.</p>

<p>Mark resisted a wild impulse to take
her in his arms—and stooping, picked up
the pup instead.</p>

<p>“Your uncle got my letter?” he asked,
in a cool formal tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, and was dreadfully concerned; but
he said you were a man of honour, and
your views and his were identical—but—I
don’t agree with them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t agree with them! What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He told auntie, of course—and of course
I insisted on her telling <i>me</i>. After all,
it was my affair. I know the obstacle—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
am ready to be your wife, just the same.
As for poverty——”</p>

<p>“Poverty,” he interrupted quickly, “is
not the question! I have a little money of
my own, and I could put my shoulder to
the wheel and work for you, Honor. It is
not that—it is that my future is overshadowed,
my reason stalked, by an hereditary
and implacable enemy. I have no
right to drag another into the pit—and,
please God, I never will! When I lived
a smooth luxurious sort of life, in those
days that seem years ago, I thirsted for
some difficult task, something to do that
would single me out and set me apart from
other men. My task has been allotted
to me; it is not what I desired——”</p>

<p>“No!” interposed Honor, whose heart
was fighting against her fate with a frenzy
of despair. “Your task is to renounce
everything—the world, and friends, and
wealth, and <i>me</i>—and to bury yourself in
these remote hills, with a crazy old gentleman
who cannot realize the sacrifice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Don’t!” with an impatient gesture of her
hand, “I know that <i>I</i> am speaking as if <i>I</i>
were mad, and in my old foolish way. I
know in my heart that you are doing what
is right—that you could not do otherwise,
and I—I am proud of you.”</p>

<p>Then, as she looked into his haggard,
altered face and miserable eyes, and caught
a glimpse of the real Mark beneath his
armour of stoicism—“But, oh, it is
hard—it is hard——” she added, as she
covered her face with her hands and
wept.</p>

<p>“Honor! for God’s sake don’t—don’t—I
implore you! I cannot bear this. I would
go through all I have struggled with
over again to save you one tear. Circumstances—destiny—or
whatever they
call it—is too strong for us. You must
not let me spoil your life. You know I
shall love you—you only as long as I draw
breath.”</p>

<p>“I know that!” raising her wet eyes
to his. “And you <i>dare</i> to talk to me of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
a good time, of marrying my second love!
Oh, Mark, Mark! how could you?”</p>

<p>“I was a brute to say it. I thought it
would make it easier for you—when——”
and his voice broke—“sometimes—when—you
think of me——”</p>

<p>“Which will be every day—and often.
And now I must be going. I was already
late enough when Tommy ran away. I
was afraid of his meeting poor Ben’s fate.
Will you come with me as far as the brow
of the hill, where our paths part?”</p>

<p>“Yes—part for ever!” he added to
himself.</p>

<p>As they turned, she asked him many
questions concerning his life, his associates,
and his occupations. He on his side
made the best of everything, painting the
Yellow Bungalow, the gardens, the planters
and missionaries with gorgeous colours.</p>

<p>“And are there no white women near
you?” she inquired. “Have you never met
one lady to speak to since you left Shirani?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have one acquaintance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
one who is a friend of yours. She is a
Persian, I believe. Your little cornelian
ring has been a strong link between us.
She is a most mysterious person. No one
can tell who she is, or where she came
from. All we know is, that she spends
her present time in doing good, nursing the
sick and dying. She told me that you knew
the history of her life—you alone——”</p>

<p>“It is true,” bending her head as she
spoke, and fixing her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>“She shrinks from all observation, but
she does not hide from <i>me</i>—for your sake;
we talk about you constantly, I may say
always.”</p>

<p>“Then give her a message from me,
please. Tell her that I often think of her,
and ask her if I may write to her, or if she
will write to me?”</p>

<p>“You forget that she is a Persian. How
can she possibly write to you?”</p>

<p>Honor coloured painfully, and twisted her
ring round and round before she spoke, and
then she said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Please give her the message all the
same. I—I—can manage to get her letter
read. <i>I</i> will understand it.”</p>

<p>They were now at the point where their
roads diverged—his went along the hill, hers
led down into the valley. She stopped for
a moment, and caressed the grey pony’s
sleek hard neck; then she turned and gave
the pony’s master both her hands. They
gazed at one another, with sad white faces,
reading their life’s tragedy in each other’s
eyes. Then she suddenly tore her fingers
from his clasp, and ran down the hill with
Tommy in pursuit. Jervis stood where she
had left him, until the very last echo of her
footsteps had died away.</p>

<p>“And that is a sound I shall <i>never</i> hear
again,” he groaned aloud, and flinging himself
down on the root of a tree, he covered
his face with his hands. How long he
remained in this attitude the grey pony
alone knew! By-and-by he became tired of
waiting—for he was either too well fed or
too sympathetic to graze—he came and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
rubbed his soft black muzzle against the
man’s short brown locks (his cap lay on the
ground). It was his poor little attempt
at consolation, and effectually roused his
owner, though it did not comfort him, for
what could a dumb animal know of the
great distresses of the human heart?</p>

<p>Honor was late for tiffin, in fact it was
getting on for afternoon teatime when she
arrived. She discovered the bungalow in
a state of unusual commotion. There was
visible excitement on the servants’ faces,
an air of extra importance (were that possible)
in the bearer’s barefooted strut—he
now appeared to walk almost entirely on
his heels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande was seated at a writing-table,
beginning and tearing up dozens of
notes; her cap was askew, her fair hair was
ruffled, and her face deeply flushed. What
could have happened?</p>

<p>“Oh, Honor, my child, I thought you
were never coming back, I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
longing for you,” rushing at her. “But
how white you look, dearie; you have
walked too far. Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“No, no, auntie. What is it? There
is something in the air. What has happened?”</p>

<p>For sole answer, Mrs. Brande cast her
unexpected weight upon her niece’s frail
shoulder, and burst into loud hysterical
tears.</p>

<p>“Only think, dear girl!”—convulsive sobs—“a
coolie has just come—and brought a
letter from P.—They have made him a
K.C.B.”—boisterous sobs—“and your poor
old auntie—is—<i>a lady at last</i>!”</p>

<p>“Major and Mrs. Granby Langrishe request
the honour of Mr. and Mrs. Blanks’s company
at St. John’s church at two o’clock on
the afternoon of the 20th inst., to be present
at the marriage of their niece and Sir
Gloster Sandilands.”</p>

<p>These invitation cards, richly embossed
in silver, were to be seen in almost every
abode in Shirani. The wedding dress was
on its way from Madame Phelps, in Calcutta.
The cake and champagne were
actually in the house. There were to be no
bridesmaids, only two little pages—“they
were cheaper,” Mrs. Langrishe said to
herself; “a set of girls would be expecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
jewellery and bouquets.” Happy Mrs. Langrishe,
who had been overwhelmed with
letters and telegrams of congratulations.
She had indeed proved herself to be <i>the</i>
clever woman of the family. It was her
triumph—more than Lalla’s—and she was
radiant with pride and satisfaction. Yea,
her self-congratulations were fervent. She
was counting the days until her atrocious
little incubus went down the ghaut as
Lady Sandilands. A little incubus, securely
fastened on another person’s shoulders—for
life!</p>

<p>Lalla was entirely occupied with letters,
trousseau, and preparations. She was to
have taken the principal part in a grand
burlesque, written specially for her, by
Toby Joy. The burlesque had been on
hand for two months, and was to bring the
Shirani season to a fitting and appropriate
close. The piece was called “Sinbad the
Sailor.” Lalla had been rehearsing her
songs and dances most industriously,
until she had been called upon to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
another part—the part of Sir Gloster’s
<i>fiancée</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Gloster did not care for burlesques;
he had never seen Miss Paske in her true
element—never seen her dance. It was
not befitting her future position that she
should appear on the boards. No, no; he
assured her that he was somewhat old-fashioned,
his mother would not like it.
She must promise him to relinquish the
idea, and never to perform in public again.
But Lalla was stubborn; she would not
yield altogether. Urged by Toby Joy, by
the theatrical troupe—who felt that they
could not pull through without their own
bright particular star—she held out in a
most unreasonable and astonishing manner.
At length she submitted so far as to declare
that “she would wear Turkish trousers, if
he liked!” This she reluctantly announced,
as if making an enormous concession.</p>

<p>“He certainly did <i>not</i> wish her to wear
Turkish trousers!” he returned, greatly
scandalized. “<i>How</i> could she make such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
a terrible suggestion?” He was heavy and
inert, but he could oppose a dead, leaden
weight of resistance to any scheme which
he disliked. This <i>he</i> called “manly determination;”
but Lalla had another name
for it—“pig-headed obstinacy!” However,
she coaxed, promised, flattered, wept,
and worked upon her infatuated lover so
successfully, that he reluctantly permitted
her to take a very small part, so as not
to have her name removed from the bills;
but this was to be positively “Her last
appearance,” and she might announce it
on the placards, if she so pleased. He
himself was summoned to Allahabad on
urgent business—in fact, to arrange about
settlements—and he would not be present,
he feared; but he would do his best to
return by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Miss Paske’s part, the dancing, singing
peri, was given to a very inferior performer—who
was the stage manager’s
despair, and a most hopeless stick. Freddy
Joy, who was in woefully low spirits respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
the certain failure of the burlesque,
and—other matters—came to Lalla on
the night but one before the play.</p>

<p>“She has got influenza—so it’s all <i>up</i>,”
making a feint of tearing his hair, “and
every place in the house sold for two
nights, and—an awful bill for dresses and
properties. What is to become of me?
Can’t you take it? It was your own
part—you do it splendidly—no professional
could beat you. Come, Lalla!”</p>

<p>“I promised I would not dance,” she
answered with a solemn face.</p>

<p>“Time enough to tie yourself up with
promises after you are married! Take
your fling <i>now</i>—you have only ten days—you’ll
never dance again.”</p>

<p>“No, never,” she groaned.</p>

<p>“He is away, too,” urged this wicked
youth; “he is not coming up till Saturday;
he won’t know, till all is over, and then
he will be as proud as a peacock. You
have your dresses, you had everything
ready until he came and spoilt the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
‘box of tricks.’” And Toby looked unutterable
things. “Did he say anything
to your aunt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No—not a word. You don’t suppose
that I allow <i>her</i> to mix herself up in my
affairs? It was merely between him and
me——”</p>

<p>“Well, you can easily smooth him
down—and if you don’t take your own
original part, I must send round a peon
this afternoon, to say that the burlesque
has been put off, owing to the illness of
the prima-donna—the ‘incapability’ is
the proper word. But you are a brick,
and you won’t let it come to <i>that</i>; you
will never leave us in a hole.”</p>

<p>A little dancing devil in each eye eagerly
assured him that she would not fail them!
Yes, the combined entreaties of her own set—their
compliments and flattery—her own
hungry craving for what Toby called “one
last fling,” carried the point. <i>He</i> would
not be back until Saturday. The piece
was for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
and she could (as she believed) easily talk
him over. Yes, she made up her mind
that she would play the peri; and she
informed her aunt, with her most off-hand
air, “that she had been prevailed on to
take the principal part; that Miss Lane
was ill (and any way would have been
a dead failure); that she could not be so
shamefully <i>selfish</i> as to disappoint every
one; that the proceeds were for a charity
(after the bills were paid there would
not be much margin)”, and Mrs. Langrishe,
in sublime ignorance of Lalla’s promise,
acquiesced as usual. She now subscribed
to all her niece’s suggestions with surprising
amiability, assuring herself that the
days of her deliverance from “a girl in
a thousand” were close at hand!</p>

<p>The burlesque of Sinbad was beautifully
staged, capitally acted, and a complete
success. Miss Paske’s dancing and singing
were pronounced to be worthy of a London
theatre—if not of a music-hall. People
discussed her wherever they met, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the men hastened, as it were in a body,
to book places for the next performance.</p>

<p>The ladies were not altogether so enthusiastic;
indeed, some of them were heard
to wonder how Sir Gloster would have
liked it?</p>

<p>Sir Gloster, on the wings of love, was
already half way through his return journey.
He had transacted his business with unexpected
promptitude, and was breakfasting
at a certain dâk bungalow, encompassed
with many parcels and boxes. Here he
was joined by two subalterns, who were
hurrying in the opposite direction—that
is, from Shirani to the plains. They were
full of the last evening’s entertainment,
and could talk of nothing but the
burlesque.</p>

<p>“It was quite A1,” they assured their
fellow-traveller. “It could not be beaten
in London—no, not even at the Empire.
Miss Paske was simply ripping!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Sir Gloster, complacently,
“I believe there is a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
of nice feeling in her acting, but she had
only a minor part.”</p>

<p>“Bless your simple, innocent heart!”
exclaimed the other, “she was the principal
figure; she was the whole show; she filled
the bill.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what you mean?” demanded
the baronet, with solemn white dignity.</p>

<p>“She was the peri—didn’t you <i>know</i>?
She dances every bit as well as Lottie
Collins or Sylvia Grey, doesn’t she, Capel?”
appealing eagerly to his comrade.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’d have gone to see her
again to-night, only for this beastly court-martial.
I gave my ticket over to Manders,
for he couldn’t get a place. She draws like
a chimney on fire; there is no squeezing in
at the door—even window-sills were at a
premium. You ought to go on, Sir Gloster;
of course <i>you</i> will get a seat,” with a significant
laugh. “This is the last performance,
and, upon my word, you should not
<i>miss</i> it.”</p>

<p>Sir Gloster remained mute. Was it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
possible that his little Lalla, who wrote him
such sweet, endearing notes, had deliberately
broken her word, and defied him?</p>

<p>At the very thought of such a crime
his white flabby face grew rigid. Seeing
was believing. He would take this crack-brained
young man’s advice, and hurry on.
He might manage to be in Shirani by eight
o’clock that evening—just in time to dress
and get to the play.</p>

<p>His wrath was hot within him—and the
anger of a quiet and lethargic person, when
once roused, is a very deadly thing. His
sturdy hill ponies bore the first brunt of
his indignation; and Sir Gloster, who was
naturally a timid horseman, for once threw
fear to the winds, and galloped as recklessly
as Toby Joy himself. He arrived at the
club just in time to swallow a few mouthfuls,
change his clothes, and set off to the
theatre. He could not get a seat, but “he
might, if he liked, stand near the door,
with his back to the wall,” and for this
handsome privilege he paid four rupees—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
best-laid-out money he ever invested, as he
subsequently declared. The curtain had
already risen; the scene looked marvellously
like fairyland. Toby Joy had just
concluded a capital topical song, when a
large egg was carefully rolled upon the
stage. The egg-shell opened without the
application of a spoon, and hatched out a
most exquisite creature, the peri, whose
appearance was the signal for a thunder of
hand-clapping. The peri—yes—was Lalla,
in very short, fleecy petticoats, with a
twinkling star in her hair—his own present,
as Sir Gloster noted with an additional
spasm of indignation.</p>

<p>Presently she began to dance.</p>

<p>Now, be it known, that her performance
was perfectly decorous and delightfully
graceful. Lalla’s glancing feet scarcely
touched the ground, and she danced as if
from pure happiness and lightness of heart.
(Toby Joy danced as if he had <i>le diable au
corps</i>.) After entrancing the spectators
for ten thrilling minutes with several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
entirely fresh variations, Lalla finished up
with the tee-to-tum spin, which is to the
dancer what the high note, at the end of
a song, is to the singer!</p>

<p>The result of this effort was a hurricane
of frantic applause, in which Sir Gloster
took no part; he was not a theatre-goer—he
was provincial. His mother and his
surroundings were strictly evangelical; and
whilst his <i>fiancée</i> enchanted the whole
station, he stood against the wall glowering
and pale. The only character present to
his mind was <i>the daughter of Herodias</i>!
Frankly speaking, the performance had
filled him with horror. That the future
Lady Sandilands should offer herself thus
to public contemplation; that any one who
chose to pay four rupees might see this
indecorous exhibition—including soldiers
in uniform, at the low price of four annas!</p>

<p>He was actually beside himself with fury,
and forced his way out, with his head down,
like a charging animal. Few noticed him
or his hasty exit; every one had eyes for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Lalla, and Lalla only. She received an
ovation and a shower of bouquets as she
was conducted before the curtain by Toby
Joy, modestly curtseying and kissing her
hand. Miss Paske subsequently remained
to enjoy a merry and <i>recherché</i> supper,
chaperoned by the invaluable Mrs. Dashwood;
and Mrs. Langrishe, as was not an
unusual occurrence, went home alone.</p>

<p>To that lady’s great amazement, she
discovered Sir Gloster awaiting her in the
drawing-room, and she gathered from his
strange and agitated appearance that something
terrible had occurred.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of writing to you, Mrs.
Langrishe,” he began in a curiously formal
voice, “but I changed my mind, and came
to see you instead. All is over between
your niece and myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe turned perfectly livid,
and dropped into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Pray, explain!” she faltered at last.</p>

<p>“Miss Paske will doubtless <i>explain</i> to
you why she gave me a solemn promise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
renounce dancing on a public stage. I
reluctantly allowed her to appear for the
last time in a very small part—that of an
old nurse. I return unexpectedly, and discover
her in the character of a ballet-girl,
exhibiting herself—well, I must say it—half
naked to the whole of Shirani. Such
a person is not fit to be my wife. She has
broken her word. She has a depraved
taste; she has no modesty.”</p>

<p>That Ida Langrishe should live to hear
such epithets applied to her own flesh and
blood!</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and
actually sobbed aloud. Who had ever seen
Mrs. Langrishe break down before? No one.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Sir Gloster,” she began
hysterically (she would need all her fascinations
now), “Lalla is so young” (only
twenty-six). “She is easily worked upon,
she is in great request; the burlesque
would have fallen through—and it is for
<i>such</i> a good charity—if she had not, at the
eleventh hour, consented to take a part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot accept your excuses, my dear
madam” (waving both fat hands, like the
flappers of an angry seal). “I could never
trust Miss Paske again. Imagine the
future Lady Sandilands, displaying her
arms—and, excuse me, her legs—in ungraceful
antics for the amusement of any
one who chose to pay two or three rupees.
At the eleventh hour, I absolutely refuse
to marry her!”</p>

<p>“You are not afraid of a breach of
promise case?” asked Mrs. Langrishe in
despair. She was indeed dying in the
last ditch.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” was the bold reply.
“No man—no gentleman is compelled to
marry an amateur mountebank! Oh, if
my poor dear mother had been present
this night, I believe the shock would have
killed her! However, I am grateful for
small mercies; I am thankful that I saw
Miss Paske in her true colours, before
it was too late!”</p>

<p>“The invitations are out days ago; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
trousseau is almost complete; the presents
have come in shoals; the cake is actually
in the house,—what <i>am</i> I to do?” pleaded
unhappy Mrs. Langrishe, in a transport
of anguish.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. I wash my
hands of the whole affair. I am going
down to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning!” repeated the
unfortunate lady.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have no personal ill-will or
ill-feeling against <i>you</i>, Mrs. Langrishe,”
he continued, as if he were offering her
some superb token of generosity. “It is
not your fault, though I must confess that
I always thought you rather spoiled Miss
Paske. However, in the present instance,
I hold you entirely blameless; but <i>noblesse
oblige</i>—and I—a—really could not ask my
mother, and friends, to receive a young
a—a—lady—whose proper sphere is pantomime
and—all that sort of thing!” And
waving his adieux, with a large tremulous
hand, he stalked out, and with him Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
Langrishe saw depart Lalla’s brilliant
prospects, her own reputation as a clever
woman, and the solid embodiment of an
immense outlay of forbearance—flattery—and
rupees.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time over the dying
wood fire, her face the colour of its ashes.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning Lalla
(a true rake at heart) had not returned,
and her impending interview was thus
postponed for twelve hours. It was past
three o’clock in the afternoon when Miss
Paske sauntered into her aunt’s room.
Mrs. Langrishe was prostrate, from the
double effect of a sleepless night and a
nervous headache.</p>

<p>Lalla listened to her outburst incredulously.
She had dressed herself with
special care, collected all her bouquets,
and had resolved to enact a pretty little
semi-penitential scene, with her stolid, easy-going,
somewhat dull <i>fiancé</i>. She expected
him now at any moment. What was this
her aunt was saying? He had come; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
seen; and fled! Impossible! He had
been present last night! For once, she
signally failed to sneer down, laugh down,
or in any way suppress or silence her
relative. Oh! she had been <i>mad</i> to listen
to Toby Joy, she was always too ready
to be over-persuaded by him. He had
had nothing on the hazard, whilst she
had her all at stake. And her magnificent
prospects, her title, her diamonds, were at
that moment rapidly rumbling down hill
in the rickety mail tonga.</p>

<p>The presents, the invitations, the breakfast—what
people would say, especially her
own people, and the not unnatural elation
of old Mother Brande, on whom she had
ruthlessly trampled—all these things flashed
through her mind.</p>

<p>She would, of <i>course</i>, be sent home
immediately. What a horrible outlook.
To remain till the end of her days, as
a sort of “object lesson,” a terrible living
example, in the corner of her father’s
large shabby country house. She would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
be pointed out to her younger sisters,
and to others, as the old maid who had
had her chance, and had danced it away!</p>

<p>During all this time her aunt was
speaking fluently, ceaselessly, passionately,
but to deaf ears—for Lalla was listening
to her own thoughts, and too much occupied
by the clamour of an inward voice to heed
these outpourings.</p>

<p>At last one sentence struck her ear.</p>

<p>“And what is to be done with the cake,
that has cost two hundred rupees, and is
now in my storeroom?” demanded Mrs.
Langrishe, dramatically.</p>

<p>“Raffle it,” cried Lalla, with a reckless
laugh, “or have another starvation picnic,
and give them wedding-cake and sugar
ornaments!”</p>

<p>“<i>Lalla!</i>” shrieked her aunt, in a voice
that would have sounded strange even to
her most intimate friends. “You are the
most abominable, unprincipled, devilish——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother!” interrupted Lalla,
savagely; and she went out of the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
and gave the door a bang that caused the
very cheval-glass to stagger in its place.</p>

<p>Once in her own bower, Lalla turned the
key and flung herself into an armchair,
knocking, as she did so, a parcel off a table
at her elbow. She stooped and picked it
up mechanically. It was a birthday-book,
one of her numerous wedding presents, and
had arrived that morning. She opened it
in order to search for the verse opposite
the date of the day. Perhaps it would give
her a clue as to her future plans. For
Lalla was extremely superstitious, and
often shaped her course by means of the
most trivial instruments, which were accepted
by her as signs, tokens, and omens.
Idiotic and preposterous as it may appear,
she attributed all her present misfortune,
not to her own deceit and folly—oh dear,
no!—but to the disastrous fact of having
had a <i>green</i> dress in her trousseau, and that
was entirely Aunt Ida’s doing, no fault of
hers.</p>

<p>Yes, Lalla had a curious temperament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and an imagination open to every fantastic
influence. As she whirled over the leaves
of the book, she said to herself, “I will
take this as final, and abide by it, for bad
or good.”</p>

<p>It was the eleventh of September, and
the lines were—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Retired from all, reserved, and coy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To musing prone alone.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Scott.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What utter bosh!” she exclaimed,
passionately; then, like all dissatisfied
inquirers, she determined to cast her first
resolve to the winds and have yet another
experiment—one more dip into the lottery
of Fate.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what it says for the twentieth—my
wedding day, that was to have
been——”</p>

<p>She turned to the page, and the lines
were—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He has not a shilling, nor has he a care.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Anon.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There, that settles it,” cried Lalla,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
tossing the hook down and moving quickly
to her writing-table.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a few hours the news of the ruptured
alliance was all over Shirani. Another
piece of intelligence was faintly whispered,
but not credited, for it was really <i>too</i> much
for the gossip-mongers to digest all at once.
This last item declared “that Miss Paske
and Mr. Joy had been seen flying down the
cart road in a special tonga. They had run
away—she, from her aunt’s reproaches, and
he, from his regimental duty. They were
both absent without leave.”</p>

<p>For once rumour proved to be true in
every particular. The pair were married at
the first church they came to, and subsequently
joined an English theatrical company
that were touring in India, and accompanied
them to the Straits Settlements,
China, and Japan.</p>

<p>Toby and Lalla act under the professional
alias of “Mr. and Mrs. Langrishe,” to the
unspeakable indignation of the rightful
owners of the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Lalla had written her aunt a most
wicked, flippant, impertinent, heartless, in
fact, diabolical letter, mentioning that the
name of Langrishe would now be surrounded
by distinction and a lustre of fame,—and
for the first time.</p>

<p>It was many months before the stately
Ida recovered her mental equilibrium, and
her spirits. The experiences she had
undergone at the hands of “a girl in a
thousand” had aged her considerably;
there are now a good many lines in her
smooth, ivory-tinted face, and silver threads
among her well-dressed brown locks.</p>

<p>Every one tacitly avoids the subject of
broken-off engagements, theatricals, and
nieces in her presence; and it would be a
truly bold woman (such as is <i>not</i> Mrs.
Brande) who would venture to inquire
“what had become of her charming niece,
who <i>was</i> to have married the baronet?”</p>

<p>“Sahib, there is some one coming—in a
jampan,” was the bearer’s surprising announcement
to Jervis, who was sitting
under a tree in the garden, busily engaged
in painting a portrait of the bearer’s grandson.
Now, a jampan, or dandy, is a sort
of hill sedan-chair, and a mode of conveyance
exclusively reserved for ladies.</p>

<p>Who could the lady be who was coming
to the Pela Kothi? thought the young
man, starting to his feet. Honor? Impossible!
Mrs. Brande? No—the big
picnic had dispersed ten days ago. He
hurried out into the verandah, and shaded
his eyes with his hand. Yes, sure enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
a dandy, borne by four men, and containing
some one holding an enormous white umbrella—some
one being carried backwards
up the hill, followed by a native on a pony
and two coolies with luggage. The <i>cortége</i>
were distinctly making for the house, for
they turned off the road into the direct
path; but all that was visible was the
white umbrella bobbing along among the
tall jungle grass—and the white umbrella
was approaching, as sure as fate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For the last week Mark had noticed a
great change in his father. As his mind
strengthened, his bodily health appeared to
fail—the hundred turns on the terrace were
gradually lessening each morning as the
steps that paced them became feebler and
feebler, and the daily routine was now
entirely set aside. An early ride had been
Mark’s chief relaxation, then breakfast with
his father, afterwards he read the paper to
him, talked to him, walked with him, until
about three o’clock, when Major Jervis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
went to sleep—and slept almost uninterruptedly
till dinner time. Meanwhile his
son walked over to see one of the neighbours,
or sketched—he had made quite a
gallery of types and portraits—or took his
gun to try his luck among the hills.</p>

<p>The major was always at his best in
the evening. He enjoyed a game of chess,
picquet, or <i>écarté</i>; and he liked to talk of his
experiences, his old friends and comrades,
to smoke, to tell the same long stories over
and over again, and it was often one or two
o’clock in the morning ere his son could
prevail on him to extinguish his hookah
and go to bed. But for the last week or
ten days there had been no late hours, and
no strolling round the garden, or basking in
the sun, and Mark had never left the place.
He feared that his father was about to have
some kind of an attack—whether bodily or
mental, he was too inexperienced to say—and
he had despatched a note that very
morning to Mr. Burgess, asking him to ride
over and see his patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the visitor was coming steadily
nearer and nearer, the umbrella effectually
concealing his or her identity. In due
time the dandy was carried up backwards
into the verandah, turned right-about-face,
and set down. And behold—under the
umbrella sat—Mr. Pollitt!</p>

<p>Mr. Pollitt, looking exceedingly pleased
with himself, and wearing a neat tweed
Norfolk jacket, a courier bag, and an
Elwood helmet. In one hand he clutched
the umbrella, in the other an Indian
Bradshaw.</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan!” almost shouted his
nephew.</p>

<p>“There, my boy! Now, now, don’t drag
me—don’t drag me. Let me get out; give
me time. I,” as he stood beside his
nephew, “thought I would take you by surprise.”
And he shook his hand vigorously.</p>

<p>“A surprise—I should just think so!
How on earth did you ever find your way
here? Why did you not write?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you everything presently—meanwhile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
get me something to drink. I
don’t want lunch—get me a drink; and
then walk me about like a horse, for my
legs are so stiff with sitting in that infernal
chair, that I believe I have lost the use of
them.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Pollitt drank off a whisky and
soda, his little eyes wandered round the big
dining-room with its faded magnificence,
then strayed to the matchless prospect from
the open window, and finally rested on his
companion.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mark, my boy! I see that this
country has not agreed with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, apparently it suits you, Uncle
Dan,” was the smiling reply. “You are
looking very fit at any rate.”</p>

<p>“And how is your father?”</p>

<p>“Rather shaky, I am afraid; he has been
ailing for the last week. He is asleep just
now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, very well, then you can explain <i>me</i>
to him when he awakes; and, meanwhile,
I have a good many things to explain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
<i>you</i>—why I am here, for instance. So, take
me outside, where I can stretch my legs.
There seems to be a great garden hereabouts.</p>

<p>“And now, to begin my story at the
beginning,” continued Mr. Pollitt, as they
paced along side by side, “I got your
letter, of course—and of course it upset me
terribly. I was like a lunatic, and it did
not smooth me down when some one kept
saying, ‘I told you so; still waters run
deep!’ and so on. At first I was resolved
to cut you adrift, and to take no further
notice of you. I was in this mind for a
whole fortnight, and then I got another
communication that drove me stark mad.
I heard through my bankers that you had
drawn on me for five thousand pounds.
Now you know, Mark,” coming to a full
stop and holding up a finger, “I have never
grudged you money, have I? but to take
it like this. Don’t interrupt me. I had
given Bostock and Bell a quiet notification
that I would honour your cheques to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
additional small extent, in case, I thought
to myself, the boy runs short of a couple of
hundred or so—but five thousand! Yes,
yes; I know you never had it! Don’t
<i>interrupt</i>, I tell you; let me go straight on.
I wrote out to Bombay at once, asking
for particulars, and the answer came back,
‘That Mr. Jervis had drawn the money
personally, in notes and gold, and had
sailed for Australia—with a <i>lady</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Sailed for Australia with a <i>lady</i>!” repeated
Mark, now halting in his turn on
the gravel walk.</p>

<p>“Yes. At first I thought that I saw the
whole thing as clear as print. Your letter
was a ruse to gain time. You knew I was
dead against your engagement to Miss
Gordon, that I wanted you to come home,
so you had just taken the matter into your
own hands, helped yourself to what would
start you fairly well, married the girl, and
emigrated to the colonies. I kept this idea
to myself, I am now most thankful to say,
and I worried and worried over the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
night and day. The whole affair was unlike
you; but it was not very unlike Clarence.
And where was Clarence? I thought of
writing and making more inquiries—indeed,
the sheet of paper was actually before me—when
I suddenly said, ‘Why should not I
go out myself, instead of twopence-half-penny
worth of paper?’ Mrs. Pollitt was
away at Homburg, I was alone, and, to tell
you the truth, had no heart for shooting or
anything. To put the matter in a nutshell,
instead of writing, I went straight off to the
P. and O. office and booked my passage to
Bombay by the following mail. I thought
I would just go out quietly and see for
myself how the land lay. I came out the
end of August. Phew! I feel hot now,
when I think of those days in the Red Sea—a
blazing sun, an iron steamer. I was
like a lobster in a fish-kettle! Needless to
say, there were no lords or dukes on board;
but I travelled with what suited me <i>better</i>—an
uncommonly clever lawyer chap, who
lives in Bombay, and put me up to everything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
We became great cronies, and as we
smoked together a good bit, I told him the
whole of my affairs, and placed myself unreservedly
in his hands; and for once in my
life I did a wise thing. He wanted me to
stay with him, but I put up at an hotel.
However, he rigged me out, engaged a
first class Goanese servant for me, who
speaks English, and takes me entirely in
charge, just as if I was a baby, and he set
about ferreting out the cheque business. I
saw the cheque—it was your signature sure
enough; but the writing of ‘five thousand
pounds’ was another hand—Clarence’s.
I discovered that he had passed off as you.
His photograph was identified at the bank.
I could not hear anything about the lady;
but she was entered in the passenger list for
Melbourne as ‘Mrs. Jervis.’ So exit Waring—and
a nice child’s guide <i>he</i> has proved!”</p>

<p>“That is not all,” burst out Mark. “He
owes money all over the place! I gave
him the command of all our funds, and he
squandered every penny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“Serve you jolly well right,” returned
his uncle with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Yes; it certainly did. I also gave him
a cheque for five hundred to pay off everything
the day I left Shirani. I was so
bothered, that I conclude that I never filled
in the cheque properly.”</p>

<p>“Evidently not, and your little oversight
cost me four thousand five hundred pounds.
Well, never mind that now. I heard pretty
stories of Clarence at the hotel—people
talking at the table beside me; how he had
gambled, betted, and played the deuce, and
made a regular cat’s-paw of the young fool
he was travelling with, meaning <i>you</i>—an
undeniable fact. I then, having finished off
Waring, came straight away to look you up,
Master Mark. Pedro, that’s my fellow,
took great care of me, and I have had as
many adventures as would fill a volume of
<i>Punch</i>. I travelled in comfort as long as I
was on the rail, bar the heat; but once the
rail came to an end, and I had to take to a
box—I am too old to begin riding—I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
uncommonly sorry for myself. However,
everything I saw was new and interesting,
the scenery splendid; I came <i>viâ</i> Shirani, of
course, and I broke my journey at the
Brandes—Sir Pelham and Lady Brande.
By the way, you never told me that he
had a handle to his name! Eh, how was
that?”</p>

<p>“And how came you to know the
Brandes?” asked his nephew gravely.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is another story! And how
came <i>you</i> to tell Sir Pelham that there was
insanity in the Jervis family, eh?”</p>

<p>“Because it is true. And I only heard it
since I came here. My grandfather died in
Richmond lunatic asylum, my uncle jumped
overboard at sea, my father has now, thank
God, a lucid interval, but he has been
insane for years.”</p>

<p>“Lies, every one of them!” blazed out
Mr. Pollitt.</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan, what do you mean?”
demanded Jervis, with trembling lips and a
pair of sternly searching eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“I know the Jervis family; why, man, I
made it my business to study it up. Your
grandfather, a splendid old soldier, died at
Richmond in his own house, as sane as I
am—saner, indeed, for I’ve been near losing
my senses several times of late. Your
uncle, noble fellow, jumped overboard to
save life and lost his own. Your father’s
head was cracked by a fall. Who told you
this other balderdash?”</p>

<p>“Fernandez, my father’s heir. He was informed
by Mrs. Jervis, my late step-mother.
And it is all true what you tell me?”</p>

<p>“As true as I am a living man and
sinner. Your father, no doubt, believed
every one of his people to be lunatics, a
phase of his own delusions.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan,” broke in his nephew, “I
don’t think you can ever realize what
you have done for me. You have restored
me—to life—to hope. That was the reason
why I gave up Miss Gordon.”</p>

<p>“And she is staunch to you still,”
nodding his head emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“How on earth do you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know a good deal, considering
that I have only been a fortnight in the
country! Mark, my dear boy, I see that
all this sudden news is too much for you.”</p>

<p>“Go on—go on,” cried the other, white
with excitement; “such news is never too
much for any one.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I came up by that
maddening, twisting cart road—I began
to think it had no ending, like eternity.
You recollect the fountains, every few
miles? At one of them, my fellows
stopped to drink and smoke, and there
was a lady watering her horse—a remarkably
handsome girl, riding a fine black
Arab. She had a white puppy on her
knee. She looked so pleasant, that though,
as you know, I’m a shy man, I ventured
to speak to her, and asked her if the road
led to any place, short of China? or if
she had ever <i>heard</i> of Shirani? Yes, she
lived there; and it was just four miles
further. We fell into talk, we were going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the same way—her horse would not stand
the puppy at any price, but reared, and
flung about like a mad thing. She sat
him splendidly, I will say, and held on
to the dog like grim death; she said he
was tired—and the long and the short of
it was, that <i>I</i> took the pup in the dandy,
and of all the nasty fidgeting little
brutes!—but that girl has such beautiful
eyes—I could do anything for her. And
I’d like to see the man that could resist
her! I told her my name, and said I
had come out after my nephew, and asked
her if she had ever heard of him—his
name was Jervis. She immediately became
bright scarlet, I do assure you, and said
‘Yes.’ I ventured to inquire her name.
She said it was Gordon; and when I
replied, ‘I have heard of <i>you</i>,’ she grew,
if possible, still redder. We became as
thick as thieves in no time. I got out
and walked beside her, actually carrying
the pup—for he would not sit in the
dandy alone—and she told me a lot about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
the hill folk, and the mountain peaks, and
taught me a few words of Hindostani. I
inquired about an hotel, and she declared
that there was none, and I must come
to her uncle’s; he and her aunt would
be very glad to see me, for Mr. Jervis
was a particular friend of theirs. And
is he not a particular friend of <i>yours</i> too?
I asked as pointedly as I knew how. And
she looked me straight in the face, and
said ‘<i>Yes</i>.’ I stayed with the Brandes,
to make a long story short, and I was
delighted with my visit. I now know
what people mean when they talk of
Indian hospitality and Indian friends. I
believe I am getting quite attached to
the country!”</p>

<p>“Then you had better remain out here,
Uncle Dan, and live with me.”</p>

<p>“A case of Mahomet and the mountain,
eh? No, no, my boy; I mean to fetch
you home. I cannot spare you. At my
age it is impossible to throw out new
roots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“And about Miss Gordon?” urged his
listener impatiently.</p>

<p>“Honor, you mean. She was charming.
She may have wished to turn my poor
silly old head, and she succeeded. She
played the violin—<i>that</i> settled me.
Yesterday morning, before I left, she and
I were walking in the garden quite early,
and she picked me a button-hole; and I
said, ‘I’m off now to see my boy. Will you
give me a flower for him, and have you
any message?’ She made no answer for
a full minute; so, to put her at ease,
I said, ‘I know all about it, my dear. I
was angry to think that he could leave
me; but what was that to leaving <i>you</i>!’
‘He did what was right,’ she said, firing
up like a sky-rocket. When we had made
peace again, she chose a flower with most
particular care, and said with a face as
red as the rose, ‘You may give him that,
with my love.’ ‘Certainly,’ I said; ‘but
the carriage must be prepaid.’ At first
she did not understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“And I must confess that I am equally
at sea,” admitted his companion.</p>

<p>“Why, you young donkey, of course I
made her give me a kiss.”</p>

<p>“Which is more than she has ever given
me. Uncle Dan, you are an extraordinarily
able man. No wonder you made a great
fortune! You have brought me nothing
but good news—my head feels reeling—I
can hardly grasp it all at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear boy, I am glad of it.
For it seems to me that you and good
news have been strangers for many a long
day! And now, suppose we go in, and find
out if your father is awake?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.<br><span class="small">ONLY MR. JERVIS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I never saw such a change in any one!”
faltered Mr. Pollitt, with some emotion, as
he followed Mark out of his father’s room.
“He is years younger than I am, and
he is so cadaverous and shrunken that he
looks seventy at the very least. Poor
fellow! he was in a desperate state at first,
when he thought I had come to carry you
off. I am glad you reassured him so completely.
Well, as long as he is here, he
shall have you. I understand matters now;
I have seen with my own eyes, and one
look is worth a ton of letters.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pollitt was enchanted with his
present quarters, with the great rambling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
house, its gardens, its situation, its quaint
furniture. The solitude and silence were
an extraordinary refreshment to the little
world-worn cockney, after the roar of the
London traffic, the throbbing of engines,
and the rumbling of railway carriages.</p>

<p>In honour of the new arrival, the khansamah
sent up a remarkably well-cooked
dinner, not at all a jungle <i>menu</i>. There
was excellent soup, fresh fish from a mountain
“tal” (a lake), <i>entrées</i>, a brace of hill
partridges, sweets, yellow cream, fruit, and
black coffee. The claret was a still further
agreeable surprise; it had been laid in by
a connoisseur, and imported direct from
Bordeaux <i>viâ</i> Pondicherry. But the greatest
surprise of all was presented in the person
of the host himself. With his heart warmed
by sound old wine and the presence of a
sound old friend, Major Jervis kindled up
into a semblance of what he once had been.
He talked connectedly and even brilliantly;
he laughed and joked, and listened with
unaffected delight to the history of Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Pollitt’s journey and adventures <i>en route</i>.
His eyes shone with something of their
ancient fire; the lines and wrinkles seemed
to fade from his face; his voice was that of
a man who could still make himself heard
on parade. Mr. Pollitt gazed and hearkened
in blank amazement; he was entranced and
carried away breathless by chronicles of
hairbreadth escapes, tiger shooting, and
elephant catching; by tales of Eastern superstitions,
of lucky and unlucky horses, places,
and people, stories of native life; of an
English nobleman who lived in a bazaar,
earning his bread by repairing carts and
ekkas; of a young officer of good family and
fortune, who had lost his head about a
native girl, had abandoned his country,
profession, and religion, and had adopted
her people, and embraced her faith; how,
in vain, his wealthy English relatives had
besought him to return to them; how they
had come out to seek him—had argued and
implored, and finally prevailed on him to
abandon his associates; and how, ere they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
had reached Bombay, they had lost him—he,
unable to break the spell of the siren,
had escaped back to his old haunts. He
told of Englishmen who were lepers, living
in sad solitude among the hills, unknown
and nameless; of the burning of witches,
of devil-worship, black magic, and human
sacrifices. The most thrilling and extraordinary
items of his past were unrolled as
a scroll, and recapitulated in vivid and
forcible language.</p>

<p>Who was this that held them spell-bound?
thought his listeners. Not the
shattered wreck of the forenoon, but the
soldier who had seen much service, who
had felt the pulse of events, who had
absorbed India through his eyes and ears—<i>real</i>
India, during a residence of thirty-five
years in that mysterious, intoxicating, gorgeous
land! Of frontier skirmishes, kept
out of the newspapers, of friendly interchanges
between foes in the field, of
mysterious disappearances, of men who had
laid down their lives for their country—heroes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
unknown to fame, whose deeds were
unrecorded by one line of print, whose
shallow graves were marked by rotting
crosses on the bleak Afghan frontier.</p>

<p>Major Jervis kept his audience enthralled;
even Mark’s attention <i>rarely</i> wandered to
a coolie who was at the moment running
through the wooded hillsides by the light of
the cold keen stars, with a letter in his
loin-cloth addressed to “Miss Gordon.”</p>

<p>It was one o’clock before the party dispersed;
and as Major Jervis clapped his
brother-in-law on the shoulder, with a
hearty good night, he added—</p>

<p>“Who knows, Pollitt, but that I may be
persuaded by your eloquence to go home
with you, after all?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“My father is very ill,” said Mark, as
he entered into his uncle’s room at eight
o’clock the next morning. “He wants to
see you. I have been with him since six
o’clock; and, Uncle Dan, I’m afraid that
this is the end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Yes, there was no doubt about that,
thought Mr. Pollitt; death was surely
written on the countenance that was turned
to him. Last night had been the final
flicker before the flame of life went out.</p>

<p>The invalid was propped up in a chair
by a window looking towards the snows;
but his face was ghastly, his breathing
laboured.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are here, Dan; glad we
met once more.” And he made a movement
as if he would offer his wasted, helpless-looking
hand. “You and Mark wanted
me to go home,” murmured the grey lips;
“and I am going—sooner than you
thought.” He turned his dull eyes and
fixed them intently on his son. “God
bless you, Mark,” he whispered almost inarticulately.
These were his last words.</p>

<p>When Mr. Burgess arrived, an hour later,
he was dead.</p>

<p>“Died of a failure of the heart’s action,
brought on by some overpowering excitement;”
but, as far as he could judge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
“under any circumstances he could not
have outlived a week.” Such was the
missionary’s verdict.</p>

<p>“Ah, sahib!” cried Mahomed, with up-raised
hands and eyes, “I knew how it
would be; there was the warning, the never-failing
warning at twelve o’clock last night—<i>the
voice</i>.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Jan Mahomed?”
Jervis returned quickly.</p>

<p>“The voice of a stranger, sahib, shouting
in the yard. He was calling for his horse.
He was going a long journey. Surely the
Protector of the poor knows the truth of
this? It is ever thus before a man’s death—there
is an order loudly spoken, ‘Gorah
tiar hye!’” (“Bring my horse!”)</p>

<p>Major Jervis was laid in the cantonment
cemetery the following morning. Mr.
Burgess read the funeral service. Mark,
Mr. Pollitt, and one or two neighbours
assembled round the grave, whilst afar off
stood servants, coolies, and many sick and
poor, and lepers, to whom the “dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
brother,” now being laid to rest, had been
a kind and generous friend.</p>

<p>Fernandez arrived, in answer to a telegram,
full of joy, bustle, and importance. He could
not understand the faces of the two Englishmen.
It was, as he frankly stated, a happy
release. He delighted in organization,
change, and excitement, and undertook all
arrangements with zeal. He seemed to be
everywhere at once. He talked, strutted,
gesticulated, and made such a stir that it
seemed as if ten men had been added to the
party.</p>

<p>“The house and land are Mark’s,” he
explained to Mr. Pollitt; “not worth
much,” shrugging his shoulders. “Everything
else comes to <i>me</i>—all the jewels. I
wish I could show you those in the bank,”
and his eyes glittered as he thought of
them. “But we will get out what is here
and let you have a look at them, for they
are native and very curious.”</p>

<p>A big safe was accordingly unlocked, the
contents brought forth and poured out, nay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
heaped, upon a crimson-covered table, which
displayed them to advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Pollitt sat down deliberately, to
examine what evidently represented an
immense quantity of money, thus sunk in
gold and precious stones. There were
aigrettes of diamonds, the jewels dull and
badly cut, but of extraordinarily great size.
There were vases and boxes of gold, and white
and green jade inlaid with rubies. Khas-dans,
or betel boxes; jars for otto of roses;
crescent ornaments for the turban, set with
emeralds and diamonds; gold anklets, with
the ends formed of elephant heads; forehead
ornaments, set with great pearls with pendant
drops; plumes or turahs for turbans,
with strings of diamonds; armlets, bangles,
rings for nose or ear, back-scratchers of
gold and ivory, glorious ropes of pearls, and
many huge unset emeralds and rubies. It
was the collection and stores of generations,
now about to be scattered to the four winds
by the plump and restless hand of Fernandez
Cardozo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“I would like to give you something,
Mark,” he said, carelessly turning over
piles of gold and precious stones as he spoke.
“Will you accept a present from me, my
good fellow?”</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” said the little
Londoner, with business-like promptitude.</p>

<p>“You joked with me about wearing a—a—necklace,
eh, you remember, when I
showed you a certain little bit of jewellery?”
Fernandez looked conscious, and
actually believed that he was blushing.
“Well now, I am going to present <i>you</i> with
one! Look at this!” holding towards him
a string of large emeralds, pierced and run
on a silken cord, and fastened off by a gold
tassel. “These are for your future bride,
Mark my boy.”</p>

<p>“How did you know about her?” eyeing
him gravely.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho! Not a bad shot, I see!
A bow drawn at a venture! Then there is
such a young lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Mr. Pollitt, “and a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
handsome young lady; you may take my
word for <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“What is she like?” turning to Mark
with sparkling eyes. “Fair or dark?”</p>

<p>“You shall see her some day, Fernandez.
You must come to our wedding.”</p>

<p>“I shall be most happy; but, my dear
fellow, <i>do</i> describe her appearance. I am
such a ladies’ man, you know, such an
admirer of beauty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is tall, a head over you, Cardozo,”
said Mr. Pollitt, “and has dark hair,
dark-grey eyes, and a very delicate colour,
the air of a princess.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then she shall have these pearls,
instead of emeralds!” cried Fernandez with
enthusiasm, plunging his fat fingers into
ropes of the former, and holding them aloft
for inspection. Four rows of large pearls
fastened off by a quaint old clasp, and a
little tassel of rubies.</p>

<p>“They are far too valuable—it is much
too handsome a gift,” objected Mark, holding
back instinctively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing is too handsome for a handsome
girl! and, for the matter of value, the
emeralds, though they look like so many
balls of green glass, beat them! If you
refuse them in her name, I assure you I
shall be quite affronted; and, surely, it is
only right that the major’s daughter should
have one small gift from amid all the
begum’s jewels.”</p>

<p>“I do not call that a small gift, Fernandez,
and I am very much obliged to
you; but I will take it to Miss Gordon,
and, later on, she will thank you personally.”</p>

<p>“They are superb!” exclaimed Mr.
Pollitt, rapturously. “I shall give her
diamonds—to correspond.”</p>

<p>Incongruous pair though they were, Mr.
Pollitt and Mr. Cardozo hit it off surprisingly
well. Fernandez’s florid manner,
Oriental ideas, and ornamental language
interested the hard-headed matter-of-fact
little Englishman. They walked and smoked
and argued noisily together, whilst Mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
rode away to visit a certain newly-made
grave, and to take leave of the Persian
lady.</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend, I have been waiting for
you,” she said, rising from the chabootra, or
band-stand. “I thought you would surely
come to say farewell. Of course you are
going away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am going away immediately.”</p>

<p>“And you will marry her—now—and
gain your heart’s desire?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. And I am come to offer
you what may fulfil yours!”</p>

<p>She stared at him with an air of almost
fierce inquiry.</p>

<p>“It is the Yellow House. Will you
accept it, for your lifetime? You said you
wished for a large bungalow in a central
position—and there you are!”</p>

<p>“The Yellow House! Oh, it is too
much. No, I could not take it, not even
for my poor. No, no, no!” and she shook
her head with an air of decision.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he argued; “it is mine to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
do with as I will; and there is nothing that
will give me greater pleasure than to feel
that it is in your hands—and the means of
doing good—instead of standing closed,
empty, and falling into ruins. There is
the garden for the patients to walk in,
the grazing for cows, the big rooms for
wards. I will thankfully pay an apothecary
and assistant, and whatever is
necessary.”</p>

<p>“You wish to establish a sort of hill
hospital for the poor in these parts?” inquired
the Persian, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Nay; you have already done that. I
only ask leave to help you. If you will
not accept the Pela Kothi from me, take it
from—us both—or from Honor. You will
not refuse her!”</p>

<p>“And shall I never see you again—or
her?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Who can say? Perhaps one day we
may come and visit you. At any rate, she
will write to you.”</p>

<p>“But how can she write to me—a—a—Persian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
woman?” looking at him with an
intensity that was not pleasant to contemplate.</p>

<p>“At least, <i>I</i> shall write to you,” he rejoined,
slightly disconcerted. “I will send
you a certain yearly sum to spend on the
wretched lepers, and in any charitable form
that you may think best. Mr. Burgess will
translate my letters for you, and also any
answers that you may be good enough to
send me. We do not wish to lose sight of
you, if we can help it.”</p>

<p>“<i>We!</i> how soon you have learnt to say
it! You are so happy, where you have
hitherto known great misery, and the poor
native woman will soon have passed from
your mind. You are released. I shall
never be released—but by death. You will
be in another world—you, and the Miss
Sahib! Will you give her this from me? It
is a little charm. Nay, do not laugh. What
am I but an ignorant, superstitious native?
Nevertheless, I mean well. This is an
amulet against sickness, poverty, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
loss of friends; an old hill woman gave it to
me. She said it never failed. I have no
friends to lose, but I am a stranger to
poverty and sickness.”</p>

<p>“I will give it to her to-morrow,” taking
from her hand a smooth dark-green stone,
about the size of a filbert. “As to having
no friends, may Miss Gordon and I not call
ourselves your friends?”</p>

<p>“How can an English lady, and an English
sahib, be the friends of—a woman of
my people?” she inquired, with a face as
expressionless as a mask.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you will,” he answered
gravely. “But I see nothing to stand
between us. Remember that we wish to
be your friends, if you will have us. And
now I’m afraid I must go.”</p>

<p>He saw her lips quiver, as she suddenly
turned away her face, and dismissed him
with a quick imperious gesture.</p>

<p>Ere he left the valley he looked back
once. The Persian was standing precisely
where he had left her. In answer to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
farewell signal, she waved a handkerchief—and
thus involuntarily betrayed herself. It
was the action of an Englishwoman!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Pollitt was actually reluctant to
abandon this life of pastoral simplicity.
The fragrant garden, the clear exhilarating
air, the sturdy simple hill folk, the view
of hill and plains, steeped in a blue or
violet haze, appeared to hold him fast.
He and Fernandez agreed to travel together
in a leisurely comfortable fashion; but
Mark would not and could not wait. He
was in love. Where love exists, it is the
only thing in life—all else is nothing. He
laid a dâk of his three ponies on the road,
and, early one afternoon, galloped off to
Shirani, with two wedding presents in his
pocket.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Perhaps the grey and bay ponies were
as anxious as their rider to return to
their former haunts; at any rate, the forty
miles which lay between the Pela Kothi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
and Rookwood were accomplished at a pace
that has never yet been approached, and
as the result of this rapid travelling, Mark
Jervis arrived a considerable time before
he was expected. That evening Lady
Brande had been entertaining a dinner-party,
one of her most superior “burra-khanas.”
People had left the table and
were assembled in the drawing-room, where
it was generally noted that Miss Gordon
was looking brilliantly handsome. Yes,
she had entirely recovered her looks. A
few months ago she had gone off most
terribly; but that queer hushed-up love
affair of hers had been quite enough to
blanch her face and waste away her flesh.
Some one was at the piano singing a
penetrating Italian love song, when it
became evident that an exceedingly late
guest was on the point of arrival. There
was the flash of a lantern outside, the
stamping of ponies’ hoofs, and the sound
of a manly voice that set Honor’s heart
beating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Sir Pelham slipped away for a moment,
and then returned and glanced significantly
at his wife.</p>

<p>She rose at once, and hurried out of the
room, and was seen through the open
verandah in animated conversation with a
young fellow in riding dress. Etiquette
forbade Honor—the most concerned—to
move. Propriety chained her hand and
foot.</p>

<p>“I hope you will excuse me,” panted
Lady Brande, returning somewhat breathless,
and addressing her guests, in a
voice between laughing and crying. “He
declares that he is not fit to appear. He
has just come back.—It is only Mr.
Jervis!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.<br><span class="small">A WEDDING WITH TWO CAKES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The following is a portion of a letter
from a lady in Shirani, to her dearest
friend on the plains:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is true that you have the hideous
journey over, all the packing, getting off
of carts, paying farewell calls, and nasty
little bills, and that you are settled on the
plains in winter quarters—all this misery
is before me. Nevertheless I think you
took up your winter quarters prematurely.
October is quite my month in the hills,
the air is so crisp and clear, you can see
for miles, the Autumn tints are exquisite,
and the low country seems veiled in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
wash, of the most exquisite cobalt and
amethyst tints.</p>

<p>“Moreover, I have been here for <i>the</i>
wedding. You want to know all about
it, of course, and I will do as I would be
done by, and begin at the very beginning.
When young Jervis unexpectedly returned,
every one was quite vulgarly astounded;
the explanation of his absence was perfectly
simple, and he brought in his train, his
uncle—the rich man—the real, true, and
only millionaire! And of course they
stayed at Rookwood, and Miss Gordon’s
engagement was given out at once—I must
say the pair looked delightfully happy. I
used to meet them riding about the pine
roads, they also came down to the club,
and tennis, and actually behaved like
reasonable people, and a great deal less like
lovers (in public), than other couples who
were not engaged. Lady Brande was
simply one large smile whenever you saw
her, and indeed she and the withered little
millionaire were preposterously radiant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
He was delighted with everything he saw.
(A complete contrast to some of our visitors
from home.) Among other things, he
appears to be particularly pleased with
his future niece; I have noticed them
constantly together—in fact, I think he
monopolized her rather more than was
fair. Lady Brande and the nephew have
always been <i>au mieux</i>! At first there was
an awful rumour that owing to a recent
affliction in the bridegroom’s family—the
death of his father—the wedding was to
be very quiet—bride to be married in her
habit, and to go away from the church.
But, after all, a compromise was effected—in
deference to Lady Brande’s wishes.
There was to be no band, no grand breakfast,
no fuss—in deference to the young
man’s wishes; but the bride was to have
an orthodox white gown, and any one who
pleased might come to the church and see
them married, and afterwards adjourn to
Rookwood for cake and champagne. Needless
to tell you, that every one pleased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
attend the only wedding of the season,
and a wedding that had an air of romance
about it, and was certainly a love match.
The presents were really tokens of good
will—not given for show, and were
‘numerous and costly,’ as they say in the
papers; the handsomest, in my opinion,
was a splendid necklace of rows of pearls,
most quaint. One of the smallest was a
button-hook from Mrs. Langrishe. I don’t
know <i>how</i> she can be so mean! I believe
she was very urgent in pressing Lady
Brande to take some of her preparations
for that other wedding off her hands.
And Lady B., who is the soul of good
nature, was forced into purchasing the
wedding cake, never unpacked—she had
a superb one, of course, from Pelitis; but
this she bought as a supplementary affair
for cutting up afterwards and sending away.</p>

<p>“Sweet Primrose and Dolly Merton were
the little bridesmaids; and as the former
insisted on having ‘a gentleman to walk
with,’ Mrs. Paul’s two handsome boys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
in white page suits, accompanied the pair
of small maids. They made the prettiest
quartette—Dolly and Sweet in such smart
frocks, Sweet looking really like a young
angel, with her golden hair. However, she
came out in her true colours before the end
of the day. I wondered that she was invited
to be present in any form, but Miss
Gordon said that Mr. Jervis particularly
wished it. There is no accounting for
tastes—of course he does not <i>know</i> her. I
declare to you, that child strutted up the
aisle, in her white silk shoes and stockings,
as if she were spurning criticism, and as if
the whole packed church full of people
were assembled solely to gaze at Sweet
Primrose! There were several outsiders
present—friends the bridegroom had picked
up—two or three young planters, whose hair
wanted cutting badly, a missionary with an
immense brown beard, who took part in the
ceremony, that funny Mr. Cardozo, who
seemed all teeth and diamond rings. The
bride wore a lovely plain white satin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
<i>the</i> pearls. She was rather nervous; but
the bridegroom was perfectly composed.
They looked so triumphantly happy coming
down the aisle arm-in-arm. After all, there
is nothing like a love match!</p>

<p>“We assembled in immense force at
Rookwood, to drink the health of the newly-married
couple. Sir Pelham made a capital
speech—neat, brief, and witty. There were
one or two unofficial remarks which may be
recorded; for example, Colonel Sladen said,
‘She came up with him—a case of the
early bird. The first day she was brought
to the club I gave her a piece of sound
advice—I told her to keep her eye on
the millionaire. Though I had got hold
of the wrong end of the stick, it appears
that she had <i>not</i>!’</p>

<p>“But it was generally acknowledged that
Sweet Primrose made <i>the</i> speech of the occasion!
fortunately it was to a comparatively
small audience. As she sat stuffing herself
with almond paste, she suddenly announced,
in that shrill little pipe of hers, ‘<i>This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Miss Paske’s wedding-cake!</i>’ And Mrs.
Langrishe, who was sitting close by, looked
as if she was about to faint, and no wonder.
Of course it was not Miss Paske’s wedding-cake;
but the prying elf, who had been to
Rookwood the previous day, whilst her
mother was examining the presents, had
overheard certain whisperings, and, having
a particular eye for <i>cake</i>, had noted cake
number two. Mrs. Sladen almost threw
herself on the child, and managed to silence
her and stifle her terrible tongue; but I
believe the imp actually exacted a solemn
promise that she was to have a large sample
of what she pleasantly called ‘<i>the other
one</i>’ at the very earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>“None of this by-play came to the eyes
or ears of the wedding party, and soon we
were all on the <i>qui vive</i> to speed the bride.
There was a great deal of kissing, but no
tears. The happy pair were accompanied
by a white dog, and drove off (quite a new
departure) in a smart victoria, which was
almost buried in slippers. If slippers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
any sign of good feeling, they are the most
popular couple that were married here for
years. I don’t believe that there is one
single old shoe to be found in the whole of
Shirani.”</p>
